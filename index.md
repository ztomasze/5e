This document is my outline of the version of 5e that I run. See [Intro](Intro.md) for more.

### Essentials (TL;DR)

I'm using 5e 2014. Most of the content here is either minor tweaks or added player options that you can choose to use beyond the standard rules provided in the Player's Handbook.

The changes listed below are significant enough that I felt they worth calling them out up front:

##### [Feats](Feats.md)

* **Great Weapon Fighter** and **Sharpshooter** trade their -5/+10 feature for a flat +PB to damage
+ Minor buffs and cosmetic tweaks for a handful of other feats.
+ Any feats taken from TCE lose their "half-feat" ASI components.

##### [Combat](Combat.md)

* Dropping to 0 hp gives you 1 level of exhaustion.
* A nat 20 always hits, but it's only a crit if the hit would have landed anyway.
* There's more everyone can do with bonus actions. You can take a bonus action as an action, or you can use it to do things like a second object interaction, overrun, tumble, etc.

##### [Conditions](Conditions.md)

* Use 2024's **exhaustion** mechanic. You can recover a limited amount of exhaustion with a short rest.
