This document is my outline of the version of 5e that I run. See [Intro](Intro.md) for more.

### Essentials (TL;DR)

I'm using 5e 2014. Most of the content here is either minor tweaks or added player options that you can choose to use beyond the standard rules provided in the 2014 Player's Handbook (PHB).

The changes listed below are those significant enough to highlight up front. Entries in **bold** reflect power-loss changes that you might want to be aware of before you use that class or feature.

##### [Classes](Classes.md)

+ Some minor nerfs:
	+ Barbarian's **Totem Warrior (Bear)**, Cleric's **Twilight Domain**, and Druid's **Wildfire Circle** each lost a little bit of power from a class feature.
	+ Paladin's **Divine Smite** now requires a bonus action (but you can potentially smite at range, and the various Smite spells have been improved).
	+ Sorcerer's **Aberrant Mind** and **Clockwork Soul** receive only half as many bonus spells, and **twinning a spell costs +1 spell point**.
	+ Warlock's **Hexblade** is disallowed by default (but Pact of the Blade is improved to reflect its essential feature).
+ Nearly all classes received minor buffs and/or added features at the top level, as well as some subclass buffs.
+ All sorcerer, warlock, and school-devoted wizard subclasses received five themed bonus spells known or prepared.
+ Most (but not all) TCE options are available, including the expanded class spell lists.

##### [Feats](Feats.md)

+ **Great Weapon Fighter** and **Sharpshooter** trade their -5/+10 feature for a flat +PB to damage
+ Any **feats taken from TCE lose their "half-feat" ASI components**.
+ Minor buffs, rulings, and cosmetic tweaks for about a dozen other feats.

##### [Combat](Combat.md)

* Dropping to **0 hp gives you a level of exhaustion**.
* A natural 20 always hits, but it's only a crit if the hit would have landed anyway.
* There's some more niche combat actions available beyond those listed in the PHB.  
* You can perform a bonus action as an action, and you can use a bonus actual to do some generally available things, like a second object interaction, overrun, tumble, etc.

##### [Spells](Spells.md)

+ Buffs available to several lesser-used cantrips and low level spells.
+ While not explicitly changed, my rulings on **Goodberry** are very strict.

##### [Conditions](Conditions.md)

* Use 2024's **"cumulative -2 to rolls, -5 to speed" exhaustion** mechanic. You can recover a limited amount of exhaustion with a short rest.

The nav bar on the left includes more pages.  The DMG and MM sections are intended more as notes for me, but they are included here if you're interested.
