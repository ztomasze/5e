This document is my outline of the version of 5e that I run. See [Intro](Intro.md) for more.

### Essentials (TL;DR)

Starting with the 2014 PHB, XGE, and TCE:

+ Any **important rule changes you should know about appear in bold** below
+ Most of the rest of this long document (broken into other pages) are options you can choose to use or minor rulings that you might want to know about, but that I think you can safely ignore until they come up in play.
+ This my default ruleset, but specific campaign docs might augment or override some of this.

##### [Classes](Classes.md)

+ Some minor nerfs:
	+ Barbarian's **Totem Warrior (Bear)**, Cleric's **Peace Domain** and **Twilight Domain**, and Druid's **Wildfire Circle** each lost a little bit of power from a class feature (or two features in the cleric case).
	+ Paladin's **Divine Smite** now requires a reaction (but this also applies to the various Smite spells).
	+ Sorcerer's **Aberrant Mind** and **Clockwork Soul** receive only half as many bonus spells, and **twinning a spell costs +1 spell point**.
	+ Warlock's **Hexblade** is disallowed by default (but Pact of the Blade is improved to reflect its essential feature).
+ **Most (but not all) TCE class options are available**.  You can check your chosen class for details.
+ Nearly all classes received a menu of minor top-level and subclass buffs.
+ All sorcerer, warlock, and school-devoted wizard subclasses receive five themed bonus spells known or prepared.

##### [Feats](Feats.md)

+ **Great Weapon Fighter** and **Sharpshooter** trade their -5/+10 feature for a flat +PB to damage
+ Any **feats taken from TCE lose their "half-feat" ASI components**.
+ Minor buffs, rulings, and cosmetic tweaks for about a dozen other feats.

##### [Characters](Characters.md)
+ You can swap out most choices you've made about class-specific features when you level up in that class.
+ Inspiration can be used before a roll, after a roll, or to recover a HD.

##### [Combat](Combat.md)

* Dropping to **0 hp gives you a level of exhaustion**.
* Dealing **nonlethal damage requires an appropriate weapon**
* A natural 20 always hits, but it's only a crit if the hit would have landed anyway.
* There's some more niche combat actions available to you beyond those listed in the PHB.  
* You can perform a bonus action as an action, and you can use a bonus action to do some generally available things, like a second object interaction, overrun, tumble, etc.

##### [Spells](Spells.md)

+ I have some **general rulings** to standardize how certain effects work, such as smite (and similar) spells, recurring areas of effect, breaking free of restraint, and augmenting a roll.
+ While not explicitly changed, my rulings are quite strict/limiting for **Goodberry** and **Conjure Animals**.
+ A modified version of **Spiritual Weapon** is encouraged: It requires concentration, but you can move it anywhere within range.
+ Spells from XGE and TCE are allowed, but **TCE's Summon spells** are nerfed a bit. Classes can use the expanded spell lists provided by TCE. 
+ Buffs are available for several cantrips and low level spells, if you want to use the provided alternate version.

##### [Conditions](Conditions.md)

* Use 2024's **"cumulative -2 to rolls, -5 to speed" exhaustion** mechanic. You can also recover a limited amount of exhaustion with a short rest.

The nav bar to the left includes more pages.  The DMG and MM sections are intended more as notes for me, but they are included here if you're interested.
