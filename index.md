This document is my outline of the version of 5e that I run. See [Intro](Intro.md) for more.

### Essentials (TL;DR)

I'm using 5e 2014. Most of the content here is either minor tweaks or added player options that you can choose to use beyond the standard rules provided in the Player's Handbook.

The changes listed below are significant enough to call out out up front:

##### [Classes](Classes.md)

+ Some minor nerfs:
	+ Paladin's **Divine Smite** now requires a bonus action (but you can potentially smite at range and the various Smite spells have been improved).
	+ Barbarian's **Totem Warrior (Bear)**, Cleric's **Twilight Domain**, and **Druid's Wildfire Circle** each lost a little bit of power from a single (overpowered) class feature.
	+ Sorcerer's **Aberrant Mind** and **Clockwork Soul** receive only a half as many bonus spells.
	+ Warlock's **Hexblade** is disallowed by default (but Pact of the Blade was improved).
+ Nearly all classes received minor buffs and added features at top level, as well as some subclass buffs.
+ All sorcerer, warlock, and school-devoted wizard subclasses receive five themed bonus spells known/prepared.
+ Most (but not all) TCE options are available, included the expanded class spell lists.

##### [Feats](Feats.md)

* **Great Weapon Fighter** and **Sharpshooter** trade their -5/+10 feature for a flat +PB to damage
+ Any feats taken from TCE lose their "half-feat" ASI components.
+ Minor buffs, rulings, and cosmetic tweaks for about a dozen other feats.

##### [Combat](Combat.md)

* Dropping to 0 hp gives you a level of exhaustion.
* A nat 20 always hits, but it's only a crit if the hit would have landed anyway.
* There's some more niche actions available in combat than those listed in the PHB.  Many of the additions are available to anyone as a bonus actions. You can take a bonus action as an action, or you can use it to do things like a second object interaction, overrun, tumble, etc.

##### [Conditions](Conditions.md)

* Use 2024's **exhaustion** mechanic. You can recover a limited amount of exhaustion with a short rest.
