This document is my outline of the version of 5e that I run. See [Intro](Intro.md) for more.

### Essentials (TL;DR)

I'm using 5e 2014 as my starting point.

+ This includes the PHB, XGE, and most (but not all) TCE options.

Where I've felt some house rules are in order:

+ I've tried to limit the explicit changes or nerfs that I make.  Where a handful did sneak in, **any required power-loss changes appear in bold** so you can be aware of them before you use that class or feature.
+ Instead of nerfs, I've favored lots of optional buffs and variants to underused features. Like TCE, you can choose to use these as a player if you'd like to.  However, just playing the base 2014 version of a class, feat, or spell is also acceptable.
+ Where I've implemented such buffs and variants, I've tried to favor 2024's version of things in most cases.  However, sometimes that 2024 change might weakened, moved into a subclass, or appear later in the class progression.
+ There are some other minor changes and rulings that I don't think significantly change the game balance or player choices, but are documented for completeness.

##### [Classes](Classes.md)

+ Some minor nerfs:
	+ Barbarian's **Totem Warrior (Bear)**, Cleric's **Twilight Domain**, and Druid's **Wildfire Circle** each lost a little bit of power from a class feature.
	+ Paladin's **Divine Smite** now requires a bonus action (but you can potentially smite at range, and the various Smite spells have been improved).
	+ Sorcerer's **Aberrant Mind** and **Clockwork Soul** receive only half as many bonus spells, and **twinning a spell costs +1 spell point**.
	+ Warlock's **Hexblade** is disallowed by default (but Pact of the Blade is improved to reflect its essential feature).
+ Nearly all classes received minor buffs and/or added features at the top level, as well as some subclass buffs.
+ All sorcerer, warlock, and school-devoted wizard subclasses received five themed bonus spells known or prepared.
+ Most (but not all) TCE options are available, including the expanded class spell lists.

##### [Feats](Feats.md)

+ **Great Weapon Fighter** and **Sharpshooter** trade their -5/+10 feature for a flat +PB to damage
+ Any **feats taken from TCE lose their "half-feat" ASI components**.
+ Minor buffs, rulings, and cosmetic tweaks for about a dozen other feats.

##### [Combat](Combat.md)

* Dropping to **0 hp gives you a level of exhaustion**.
* A natural 20 always hits, but it's only a crit if the hit would have landed anyway.
* There's some more niche combat actions available beyond those listed in the PHB.  
* You can perform a bonus action as an action, and you can use a bonus actual to do some generally available things, like a second object interaction, overrun, tumble, etc.

##### [Spells](Spells.md)

+ Buffs are available for several cantrips and low level spells. Lots of spells are now cooler (if you want them to be).
+ I have some **general rulings** to standardize how certain effects work, such as smite (and similar) spells, recurring areas of effect, breaking free of restraint, and augmenting a roll.
+ While not explicitly changed, my rulings are quite strict/limiting for **Goodberry** and **Conjure Animals**.
+ A modified version of **Spiritual Weapon** is encouraged: It requires concentration, but you can move it anywhere within range.
+ Spells from XGE and TCE are allowed, but **TCE's Summon spells** are nerfed a bit. 

##### [Conditions](Conditions.md)

* Use 2024's **"cumulative -2 to rolls, -5 to speed" exhaustion** mechanic. You can recover a limited amount of exhaustion with a short rest.

The nav bar on the left includes more pages.  The DMG and MM sections are intended more as notes for me, but they are included here if you're interested.
