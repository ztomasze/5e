Suffocating
As RAW: You are either holding your breath or not. 
PHB p.177 also mentions you might need to make a Constitution-based roll for holding your breath.  Specifically, this means:
You can grab a breath as a free action on your turn.
If you are denied your breath when it's not your turn (pulled into the water, strangled, suddenly surrounded by gas or spores, etc), you are not holding your breath. Depending on the situation, you may get a DC 10 CON save to grab a breath as a reaction.
You can lose your breath by talking, casting a spell with a verbal component, falling unconscious, etc.  Also, whenever you take damage (or suffer a similar significant surprise), you must make a Concentration save (as per concentrating on a spell) or lose your breath.
