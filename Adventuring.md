## Movement
#### Travel Pace

| Pace   | Base | Perception   | Stealth      |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Fast   | 40'  | Disadvantage | none         |
| Normal | 30'  | Normal       | Disadvantage |
| Slow   | 20'  | Advantage    | Normal       |

Remember that adv/disadv means +5/-5 to passive Perception.

*(Updated from 2024, except no Stealth at Fast and Survival effect covered below instead)*

#### Activities while Traveling

If you are traveling at a normal or slower pace, you can take disadvantage on Perception to perform an extra task, such as track, forage, navigate, draw a map, etc.  At a fast pace, you're also at disadvantage to any task rolls.

## Environment

<!--2024's Dehydration / Malnutrition rules kept the same requirements as PHB + DMG p.111, but tweaked the rules on how you gain exhaustion levels.  The change is not really any clearer IMO.-->

#### Burning
If you are burning, you take 1d10 (5) damage at the start of each of your turns. You can extinguish the flames by taking an action to make a DC 10 DEX check.  Dropping prone and rolling on the ground gives you advantage on this roll.  Smothering the flames or submersion in water will also end this condition.  *(Inspired by 2024's Burning condition, plus a desire to standardize some of the different 2014 things that can set you on fire.)*

If a square is burning, it becomes damaging area of effect that deals 1d10 (5) fire damage when a creature enters it or ends its turn there.  (See *[Spells](Spells.md): General Rulings: Recurring areas of effect* for more.)

Different sources of fire may change the amount of damage you take. The source also determines how long the fire will burn (such as 2 rounds for oil, 1 minute for alchemist's fire, or until extinguished for elemental monster attacks).

#### Falling

For a treacherous fall (DM's discretion), the d6s can explode: If you roll a 6, roll that die again until it's not a 6, adding each result to the total. *(This keeps the core falling rule in place, but it allows for a rare fatal fall at shorter heights, and it means even those with several levels of HP should still fear falling.)*

#### Suffocating

As RAW: In the absence of air, you are either holding your breath (for 1+CON minutes, min: 30 seconds) or suffocating (CON rounds, min 1; then drop to 0 hp at the start of your next turn).  <!-- 2024 uses Exhaustion each round instead of CON rounds + 0 hp -->

Some clarifying rulings:

+ If you are unexpectedly denied your breath (pulled into the water, strangled, choking, suddenly surrounded by gas or spores, etc), you are not holding your breath and so immediately start suffocating. <!-- Depending on the situation, you may get a DC 10 CON save to grab a breath as a reaction. -->
+ While suffocating, if the opportunity presents itself, you can grab a deep breath as a free action and start holding your breath again.
+ While holding your breath, you can lose your breath by talking, casting a spell with a verbal component, falling unconscious, etc.  Also, whenever you take damage or suffer a similarly significant surprise, you must make a Concentration save (as per concentrating on a spell) or lose your breath.  *(Inspired by PHB p.177 - roll CON to hold your breath.)*

## Resting

#### Excursion

Sometimes, the party will venture deep into the wilds or some other inhospitable domain. On such excursions, while under the general wear of long travel or the uncertainty of finding the next safe haven, the party's rests become less productive:

- A **hour's rest** provides only a **brief rest** (heal 1 hp).
- A **night's rest** provides only a **short rest**.

For a night's rest to provide as a long rest, it must be taken in a safe haven (as defined by the DM).  

+ "Daily" or "at dawn" uses of a magic items that require attunement only recharge while they are attuned over a long rest. Otherwise, they are recovered on a night's rest. 
+ Prepared spellcasters can re-prepare their spells with a night's rest.
