### PHB Feats

The following states the optional changes (rather than giving full replacement text) for certain feats.  **Bold changes** are required.

#### Athlete

* *Add:* Add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.
* *(Originally from Fighter: Champion; this feat could use some help.)*

#### Charger

+ *Replace* with: 
	+ You can Dash as a bonus action.
	+ Once per turn, if you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before you hit with a melee attack as part of the Attack action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack's damage (if you choose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).
+ *(Buff to a weak feat: Add free dash and let you charge on any Attack action.  Change to Attack action inspired by the 2024 version. See Weapon Mastery Properties sidebar below for more.)* 

#### Crossbow Expert

* The avoidance of disadvantage while firing in melee **only applies to weapon attacks**.
* *(Although still useful for bows and guns, this feat shouldn't make mages better. See Spell Sniper for the magical version.)*

#### Defensive Duelist

* *Add:* If you are wearing light or no armor, wielding a finesse melee weapon with which you are proficient in one hand, and carrying nothing in your other hand, you can assume a fencer's stance to gain +2 AC. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed is reduced to 0.
* *(Basically equivalent to carrying a shield + rapier, but with better visuals.)*

#### Dual Wielder

* *Add:* When you are two-weapon fighting with a light melee weapon in each hand (or with a rapier & and a dagger in your offhand), you can make the additional off-hand attack as an extra attack during your Attack action instead of as a bonus action.
* *(This addition is 2024's Nick weapon property. See Weapon Mastery Properties sidebar below for more.)*

#### Durable

* Instead of rolling a Hit Die when you expend it to regain hit points, you regain hit points equal to its maximum value. 
* *Add:* If damage reduces you to exactly 0 hp, you are automatically stable.
* *(Buff and ensures that this benefit scales better for all HD sizes. The second point is a house-rule I like, but I'll add it here instead of for everyone.)*

#### Grappler

* Prerequisite is Strength 13+ *or Dexterity 13+*
* The advantage you have on attacks rolls versus an opponent you are currently grappling also applies to most combat maneuver contests (see [Combat](Combat.md)).
* *Add*: You can attempt a grapple in place of any attack, rather than only those made as part of the Attack action.
* *Add:* When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.
* Note: Since everyone can now attempt to Pin (restrain), the second bullet is no longer unique to this feat.
* Note: The third bullet was a PHB editing error and so is generally never applicable.
* *(Buffed because this feat was pretty weak, especially after making pin/restrain available to all. Incorporated some ideas, like punch-and-grab, from the 2024 version.)*

#### Great Weapon Master

* **Instead of -5 to hit for +10 damage**, add your proficiency bonus to damage rolls for all melee attacks made with a heavy melee weapon that you are proficient with. 
* *(This feature was too strong; change inspired by 2024's GWM change.)*

#### Keen Mind

* Instead of the last 3 bullet points, gain proficiency in one tool or knowledge skill (Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion). 
* *(Prefer something more crunchy and useful here; compare to Linguist or 2024's version.)*

#### Magic Initiate

+ You can also cast the level 1 spell you learn using any spell slots you have.
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Polearm Master

- A spear is a valid option for both abilities. *(As allowed per errata)* 
- **The haft attack does not have reach.**  However, when using a glaive or halberd, a haft-equivalent d4 attack can be made with reach by using a backside hook or spiked tip, but it deals slashing or piercing.
- You cannot make a haft attack while wielding a quarterstaff or spear one-handed.  However, if wielding a shield in your offhand, you can make a haft-like d4-damage attack with the shield. 
- *(Tweaked for more believable flavor, invoking ancient world shield-and-spear wall tactics, but retaining close to the same power as granted to staffs and spears as confirmed by sage advice.)*

#### Savage Attacker

* *Add:* When you miss with a heavy melee weapon attack, you can deal damage to the creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type as the weapon, and it can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.
* *(Feat felt weak. This addition is 2024's Graze weapon property. See Weapon Mastery Properties sidebar below for more.)*

#### Sharpshooter

* **Instead of ignoring long range penalties**, you can shoot without disadvantage only up to double the weapon's normal range.
* **Instead of -5 to hit for +10 damage**, add your proficiency bonus to damage rolls for all ranged attacks made with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with. 
* *(Shooting a longbow 600 feet without an accuracy penalty is hard to believe and has ruined a couple encounters for me. The -5/+10 feature is too strong; change inspired by 2024's GWF change.)*

#### Shield Master

* If you commit to taking an Attack action this turn, you may perform the bonus action shove before you attack.
* *(Because that's how you'd do it if you were really a shield master!)*

#### Spell Sniper

* *Add:* Being within 5' of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls.  
* *(This feature was added in 2024; see also Crossbow Expert)*

#### Tavern Brawler

* Note: The bonus action to grapple can instead be used to shove.
* *(See Weapon Mastery Properties sidebar below for more.)*


### Other Feats

* XGE’s racial feats retain their "half-feat" ability score improvements (ASI)
* **TCE’s feats lose their ASI components**.

#### Crusher

* You can only move the creature in line with your weapon attack. This means horizontally to either side or away from you for a swung melee attack or back along the line of fire for a ranged attack.

#### Gunner

* **Disallowed.**
* *(Firearms are different in each of my campaigns depending on the setting and what role firearms play in it. Look for a similar option in the relevant campaign doc.)*

#### Skill Expert

* Instead of gaining one proficiency and one expertise, you may gain expertise on two different skills that you already have.


> **Weapon Mastery Properties**  
> I'm not a big fan of 2024's weapon mastery properties, so I don't care to backport them as a regular mechanic here. However, if they are of interest to you, you can still approximate them through [feats](Feats):
> 
> + Cleave: Great Weapon Master
> + Graze: Savage Attacker (revised)
> + Nick: Dual Weapon Wielder (revised)
> + Push: Charger / Crusher
> + Sap: Slasher (on crit)
> + Slow: Slasher
> + Topple: Tavern Brawler (revised) (unarmed/improvised only)
> + Vex: Crusher (on crit)
>   
> Alternatively, check out the [Rogue](Classes.md)'s new Cunning Strike for the Sap, Slow, Trip (~Topple), and Vex abilities.
