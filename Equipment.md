### Armor

##### Shields
It takes only a bonus action to don or doff a shield (in addition to any object interaction needed to draw or stow the shield).

##### Swimming
You are at disadvantage to swim in medium or heavy armor or while wielding a shield. If that armor also imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks, you can't swim at all.

### Weapons

##### Ammunition
Although it typically requires a free hand to draw ammunition, a sling can be reloaded while wielding a shield.  

##### Additional Weapons

| Weapon      | Type          | Cost | Damage           | Weight | Properties                                      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Sap**     | Simple Melee  | 5 sp | 1d6 bludgeoning* | 2 lb   | Deals only non-lethal damage                    |
| **Garotte** | Martial Melee | 1 gp | \*               | 1/2 lb | Special, two-handed.  <br>Rogues are proficient |

**Garrote:** You can use a garrote to initiate a grapple of a creature your size or smaller using DEX(Acrobatics). When you grapple a target with a garrote, the target cannot speak or breathe, and they take 1d4 slashing damage at the end of each of their turns while they remain grappled.

### Gear

**Oil:** Instead of adding 5 points of fire damage to any fire-based attack on an oil-soaked creature, any spark or fire damage ignites the oil. Ignited oils burns for 2 rounds, either on a creature or in a square.  The burning oil deals 5 (1d10) damage at the start of an affected creature's turn, whether that creature is doused or standing in a burning square.  (See also: [Adventuring](Adventuring.md): Fire.)  
*(Trying to standardize burning effects to the start of turn. Compare to alchemist's fire and 2024's Burning condition. Compared to alchemist's fire, oil burns out faster and is easier to extinguish, but it does more damage in the short term.)*
