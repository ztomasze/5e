Armor
If an armor imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks, it also imposes disadvantage on Athletics checks to swim.  (Except for padded, but no one ever wears that.)

Natural weapons
You can attack with finesse, applying your DEX bonus to attack. However, when you do so, you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the attack, unless that modifier is negative (similar to making an offhand attack).

Quarterstaff 
Can be used to attack with each end, as if you held a d6 bludgeoning weapon in each hand.
If you have proficiency with martial weapons or monk weapons, you can make an attack with a quarterstaff as a reach weapon. You must be holding the weapon in two hands to do this, and the damage die on a hit is a d6.

Shields
It takes only a bonus action to don or doff a shield (in addition to an object interaction to stash or retrieve the shield).

Slings
Can be loaded while wielding a shield.  When using a loaded sling as an improvised weapon to make a melee attack, you can attack with finesse, applying your DEX bonus to attack. However, when you do so, you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the attack, unless that modifier is negative (similar to making an offhand attack).

Spear
If you have proficiency with martial weapons or monk weapons, you can make an attack with a spear as a reach weapon. You must be holding the weapon in two hands to do this, and the damage die on a hit is a d6.
