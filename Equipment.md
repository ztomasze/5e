### Armor

##### Shields
It takes only a bonus action to don or doff a shield (in addition to an object interaction to also draw or stow the shield).

##### Swimming
You are at disadvantage to swim in medium or heavy armor or while wielding a shield. If that armor also imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks, you can't swim at all.

### Weapons

##### Ammunition
Although it typically requires a free hand to draw ammunition, a sling can be reloaded while wielding a shield.  

##### Additional Weapons

| Weapon      | Type          | Cost | Damage           | Weight | Properties                                      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Sap**     | Simple Melee  | 5 sp | 1d6 bludgeoning* | 2 lb   | Deals only non-lethal damage                    |
| **Garotte** | Martial Melee | 1 gp | \*               | 1/2 lb | Special, two-handed.  <br>Rogues are proficient |

**Garrote:** You can use a garrote to initiate a grapple of a creature your size or smaller using DEX(Acrobatics). When you grapple a target with a garrote, the target cannot speak or breathe, and they take 1d4 slashing damage at the end of each of their turns while they remain grappled.

### Gear

**Oil:** Instead of adding 5 points of fire damage to a oil-soaked creature, any spark or fire damage ignites the oil.  Ignited oils burns for 2 rounds. It deals 5 (1d10) damage at the start of a burning creature's turn if that creature is doused or standing in a burning square.  (See also: [Adventuring](Adventuring.md): Fire.) *(Trying to standardize burning effects to start of turn. Compare to alchemist's fire and 2024's Burning condition. Oil burns out, but it does more damage in the short term.)*
