### Armor

##### Shields
It takes only a bonus action to don or doff a shield (in addition to an object interaction to also draw or stow the shield).

##### Swimming
You are at disadvantage to swim in medium or heavy armor or while wielding a shield. If that armor also imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks, you can't swim at all.

### Weapons

##### Ammunition
It typically requires a free hand to draw ammunition. A sling can be reloaded while wielding a shield.
