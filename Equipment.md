### Armor

##### Shields
It takes only a bonus action to don or doff a shield (in addition to any object interaction needed to draw or stow the shield).

##### Swimming
You are at disadvantage to swim in medium or heavy armor or while wielding a shield. If that armor also imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks, you can't swim at all.

### Weapons

##### Ammunition
Although it typically requires a free hand to draw ammunition, a sling can be reloaded while wielding a shield.  

<!--
Quarterstaff 
Can be used to attack with each end, as if you held a d6 bludgeoning weapon in each hand.
If you have proficiency with martial weapons or monk weapons, you can make an attack with a quarterstaff as a reach weapon. You must be holding the weapon in two hands to do this, and the damage die on a hit is a d6.

Spear
If you have proficiency with martial weapons or monk weapons, you can make an attack with a spear as a reach weapon. You must be holding the weapon in two hands to do this, and the damage die on a hit is a d6.

| ----------- | -------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sap**     | Simple Melee   | 5 sp | 1d6 bludgeoning* | 2 lb   | Deals only non-lethal damage                                                                                                                     |
| **Bolas**   | Martial Ranged | 1 gp | 1d4 bludgeoning  | 2 lb   | As per Net, but 20/60 range, deals damage on hit, and only grapples rather than restrains.                                                       |
| **Garotte** | Martial Melee  | 1 gp | \*               | 1/2 lb | Special, two-handed.  <br>Rogues are proficient                                                                                                  |
| **Lasso**   | Martial Ranged | 5 cp | *                | 3 lb   | As per Net but double the range. The restrained target can still move as long as it moves closer to you. Releasing the lasso ends the condition. |

**Garrote:** You can use a garrote to initiate a grapple of a creature your size or smaller using DEX(Acrobatics). When you grapple a target with a garrote, the target cannot speak or breathe, and they take 1d4 slashing damage at the end of each of their turns while they remain grappled.

### Gear

**Antitoxin:** If you are currently poisoned, you can immediately repeat the save against that condition.  You then gain advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour.  *(Adding the chance for antitoxin to have some benefit to an existing condition, even if that condition doesn't have an ongoing save.)*

**Manacles:** Use the much more detailed 2024 version: *As an action, you can use manacles to bind an unwilling small or medium creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the grappled, incapacitated, or restrained condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. While bound, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, and the creature is restrained if the manacles are attached (requiring a second action) to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check as an action. Each set of manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use Thieves' Tools to pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.*

**Poison, Basic:** If you are proficient with a poisoner's kit, you can apply poison as a bonus action. Works only on a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage. The poison damage is automatic (no save). *(Inspired by 2024)*

##### Grenade-like weapons

This covers fist-sized damaging items that you throw or splash, such as **acid**, **alchemist's fire**, **holy water**, or **oil**.

+ As an action, you can use the item to target a creature or space within 20 feet of you and make an improvised weapon attack. *(As per 2014)*
	+ If you are proficient with glassblower's or potter's tools, you are proficient when attacking with any flask or vial.
	+ If you are proficient with alchemist's tools, you are proficient when attacking with acid, alchemist's fire, or oil.
	+ If you can create holy water (cleric, paladin, or have access to the *Ceremony* spell), you are proficient when attacking with holy water.
+ This can be either a melee attack as you splash the target with the contents of the container or a ranged attack if you try to hit it with a thrown flask.
	+ For the melee attack, you can use either Strength or Dexterity.
+ You can target either a creature or square.
	+ A target creature's AC for this attack is 10+DEX. On a miss, see if your attack roll is sufficient to still hit the square it is in.
	+ It is AC 5 to hit a target square. On a miss, you hit a random neighboring square instead.
+ Upon hitting a creature with a thrown flask, roll a d20 <= their AC to see if the flask breaks against their body.  If not, it falls to the ground at their feet and breaks there instead.
	+ If you are proficient with glassblower's or potter's tools, a container you throw always breaks on a hit.
	+ If the flask breaks against a creature and deals damage, you can add your ability modifier to that damage (as normally done for weapon attacks).

**Acid:**  Deals 2d6 acid damage. If breaking on the ground, it deals 1d6 damage to any creature in that space.

**Alchemist's fire:**  Deals 1d4 fire damage immediately upon hitting a creature. It then ignites either the creature or square that it hit, burning for up to 1 minute. (See [Adventuring](Adventuring.md): Burning) 

**Holy Water:** Deals 2d6 radiant damage to undead or fiend.  If breaking on the ground, it deals 1d6 damage to such creatures in that space.

**Oil:** Soaks either the creature or square. Any subsequent spark or fire damage ignites the oil, which then burns for 2 rounds. (See [Adventuring](Adventuring.md): Burning)

| Item               | Cost | Weight | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Smelling salts** | 2 gp | 1/2 lb | Use this vial of spirit of hartshorn to wake an unconscious creature. If the creature is stable at 0 hp, they regain 1 hp. Can be crafted with an Herbalism kit. |

### Tools

A tool proficiency includes use of the tool, but also its surrounding knowledge.

* For example, proficiency in mason's tools also gives you knowledge of the history of stonework and proficiency in assessing weak points or detecting unusual or concealed constructions in worked stone. (XGE's section on tools give many more illustrative examples of this for other tools.)
* You do not need to have your tools on hand to benefit from the associated knowledge.

Whenever tool and skill proficiencies overlap, you can use either one.  If you have both, you gain advantage on the roll.  *(From XGE and 2024)*

+ Examples include Performance and a musical instrument to impress an audience with your playing; Insight and a gaming set to determine if your opponent is cheating at the game; Sleight of Hand and thieves' tools to pick a lock or disarm a trap.

Tool proficiencies also let you repair related items over a short or long rest, or craft new items or earn a living during downtime. 

+ You need your tools on hand for this.

#### Additional Tools

##### Miner's Tools
*15 gp, 10 lbs*  
A proficient character can recognize ores, determine whether a cavern is natural or excavated, and can identify weak spots in natural or excavated stonework. You can use your tools to excavate veins of ore or pan for gold.

##### Rope
A proficient character can reliably tie knots; can splice a cut rope back together over a short rest; can repair or craft a lasso or bolas.
