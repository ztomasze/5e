### Armor

##### Shields
It takes only a bonus action to don or doff a shield (in addition to any object interaction needed to draw or stow the shield).

##### Swimming
You are at disadvantage to swim in medium or heavy armor or while wielding a shield. If that armor also imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks, you can't swim at all.

### Weapons

##### Ammunition
Although it typically requires a free hand to draw ammunition, a sling can be reloaded while wielding a shield.  

<!--
Quarterstaff 
Can be used to attack with each end, as if you held a d6 bludgeoning weapon in each hand.
If you have proficiency with martial weapons or monk weapons, you can make an attack with a quarterstaff as a reach weapon. You must be holding the weapon in two hands to do this, and the damage die on a hit is a d6.

Spear
If you have proficiency with martial weapons or monk weapons, you can make an attack with a spear as a reach weapon. You must be holding the weapon in two hands to do this, and the damage die on a hit is a d6.

##### Additional Weapons

| Weapon      | Type           | Cost | Damage           | Weight | Properties                                                                                               |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sap**     | Simple Melee   | 5 sp | 1d6 bludgeoning* | 2 lb   | Deals only non-lethal damage                                                                             |
| **Bolas**   | Martial Ranged | 1 gp | 1d4 bludgeoning  | 2 lb   | As per Net, but 20/60 range, deals damage on hit, and only grapples rather than restrains.               |
| **Garotte** | Martial Melee  | 1 gp | \*               | 1/2 lb | Special, two-handed.  <br>Rogues are proficient                                                          |
| **Lasso**   | Martial Ranged | 5 cp | *                | 3 lb   | As per Net but double the range. The restrained target can still move as long as it moves closer to you. |

**Garrote:** You can use a garrote to initiate a grapple of a creature your size or smaller using DEX(Acrobatics). When you grapple a target with a garrote, the target cannot speak or breathe, and they take 1d4 slashing damage at the end of each of their turns while they remain grappled.

### Gear

**Antitoxin:** If you are currently poisoned, you can immediately repeat the save against that condition.  You then gain advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour.  *(Adding the chance for antitoxin to have some benefit to an existing condition.)*

**Oil:** Instead of adding 5 points of fire damage to any fire-based attack on an oil-soaked creature, any spark or fire damage ignites the oil. Ignited oils burns for 2 rounds, either on a creature or in a square.  The burning oil deals 5 (1d10) damage at the start of an affected creature's turn, whether that creature is doused or standing in a burning square.  (See also: [Adventuring](Adventuring.md): Fire.)  
*(Standardizing burning effects to the start of turn. Compare to alchemist's fire and 2024's Burning condition. It's possible to jump over/through a burning square, but you can't linger there. Compared to alchemist's fire, oil burns out faster and is easier to extinguish, but it does more damage in the short term.)*

| **Smelling salts** | 2 gp | 1/2 lb | Use this vial of spirit of hartshorn to wake an unconscious creature. If the creature is stable at 0 hp, they regain 1 hp. Can be crafted with an Herbalism kit. |

### Tools

A tool proficiency includes use of the tool, but also its surrounding knowledge.

* For example, proficiency in mason's tools also gives you knowledge of the history of stonework and proficiency in assessing weak points or detecting unusual or concealed constructions in worked stone. (XGE's section on tools give many more illustrative examples of this for other tools.)
* You do not need to have your tools on hand to benefit from the associated knowledge.

Whenever tool and skill proficiencies overlap, you can use either one.  If you have both, you gain advantage on the roll.  *(From XGE and 2024)*

+ Examples include Performance and a musical instrument to impress an audience with your playing; Insight and a gaming set to determine if your opponent is cheating at the game; Sleight of Hand and thieves' tools to pick a lock or disarm a trap.

Tool proficiencies also let you repair related items over a short or long rest, or craft new items or earn a living during downtime. 

+ You need your tools on hand for this.

#### Additional Tools

##### Miner's Tools
*15 gp, 10 lbs*  
A proficient character can recognize ores, determine whether a cavern is natural or excavated, and can identify weak spots in natural or excavated stonework. You can use your tools to excavate veins of ore or pan for gold.

##### Rope
A proficient character can reliably tie knots; can splice a cut rope back together over a short rest; can repair or craft a lasso or bolas.
