### Rationale

The 5th edition (5e) of Dungeon & Dragons (D&D) was released in 2014. A number of additional rule options were added with *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* (TCE) in 2020. With the release of the 2024 edition of 5e, there are even more changes to the core rules. 

In addition, the original *Player's Handbook* (PHB), *Dungeon Master's Guide* (DMG) and *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* (XGE) offer a Dungeon Master (DM) many optional rules to choose from. And nearly every DM has their own set of house rules and table rulings that reflect how they have tweaked or interpreted the rules for their particular style or gaming group.

**This document is my collection of such choices and house rules.**

In general:

* I am sticking with 2014 as my starting point, including XGE and TCE content.
* After many rule experiments over the past decade, I'm currently doing my best to stick closer to the published version of the 2014 core rules... but there are still some things I feel strongly about. 
* Where possible, I've tried to add optional features or player options, instead of changing existing rules or features.  Aside from the few exceptions called out in **bold** on the [index](index.md) page, you can safely stick with the original 2014 rules if you want to.
* Where 2024 has made rule changes, I've incorporated the changes that I really like or else I've used their change as an excuse to make a different tweak that I prefer.
* I am generally open in to incorporating any officially published option, but talk to me first if it's not covered here.

### Format

This document follows the same chapter structure as the 2014's PHB, DMG, and Monster Manual (MM).
