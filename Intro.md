### Rationale

The 5th edition (5e) of Dungeon & Dragons (D&D) was released in 2014. A number of additional rule options were added with *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* (TCE) in 2020. With the release of the 2024 edition of 5e, there are even more changes to the core rules. 

In addition, the original *Player's Handbook* (PHB), *Dungeon Master's Guide* (DMG) and *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* (XGE) offer a Dungeon Master (DM) many optional rules to choose from. And nearly every DM has their own set of house rules and table rulings that reflect how they have tweaked or interpreted the rules for their particular style or gaming group.

**This document is my collection of such choices and house rules.**

In general:

* I am sticking with 2014 as my starting point.  For players, this includes the PHB, XGE, and (most) TCE content.
* After many rule experiments over the past decade, I'm currently doing my best to stick closer to the published version of the 2014 core rules... but there are still some things I feel strongly about. Where I have made explicit/required changes, I've called them out in **bold** on the [index](index.md) page, 
* Instead of making required changes, I've tried instead to add additional features or player options to underused features.  You can choose to use these as a player if you'd like to, but you can also safely stick with the original 2014 rules if you want to.
* Where I've felt a buff and variant would be valuable, I've tried to favor 2024's version of things in most cases. However, sometimes that 2024 change might be weakened, moved into a subclass, or appear later in the class progression.
* There are several other minor changes and rulings that I don't think significantly change the game balance or player choices, but they are documented here for completeness.  This is in large part for myself, so I can be consistent in how I run the game.
* I am generally open in to incorporating any officially published option; talk to me if it's not covered here.

### Format
