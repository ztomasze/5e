This is a toolbox of structures the DM might use to handle the resolution of narrative challenges.

### Individual Roll

This is the standard covered in the rules: A single character makes an ability/skill check, save or attack versus as DC to succeed or fail.  There may be a consequence for failure, especially with saves.

### Parallel Rolls

Sometimes multiple characters are caught in the same effect and all separately make a save and suffer the effects according their individual results.

This can also occur with skill rolls, where each person in the group has to make a individual roll or suffer a consequence.

**Examples:**
+ Survival to navigate through a marsh. Each character that fails incurs 1 exhaustion from the toll of wading, thick mud, biting insects, etc.
+ Athletics to climb a rugged gravel incline.  Each character that fails suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage from slips, slides, or a minor fall.
+ Acrobatics to pick your way through brambles, suffering 1d6 piercing damage (or perhaps exposure to a minor poison) on a failure.

### Strongest / Weakest Link

Each character in the group makes a given skill roll.

+ In strongest link: If one character succeeds, the party succeeds.
+ In weakest link: If one character fails, the party fails.

**Examples:**
+ Most knowledge rolls (Arcana, History, Nature, Religion) made to recall a fact tend to be strongest link: If one character remembers or determines some fact, they can tell the rest of the party.
+ Most detection rolls (Investigation, Insight, Perception) are the same: As long as one party member notices or determines some fact, they can tell the rest of the party.
+ Stealth is often run as a weakest link: If one character fails, it gives away the whole party.

*Note: Weakest link usually isn't very fun. A group roll can often feel better.*

### Group Roll

As per PHB, the party each makes the same skill roll versus the same DC.  The party then succeeds together if half or more of the individual rolls succeed. (You could optionally do a sort of critical or total success if all rolls succeed, or a critical/total failure if all fail.)

This works well for a single clear challenge where the party members can help each other out and the main question is simply whether they succeed or not.  

**Examples:** 
+ Investigation to search the burning library for the scroll rumored to be there (where failure means they don't find it in time)
+ Acrobatics to traverse the windy ice-ledge after tying the party together on a single rope (where failure means all fall)
+ Survival or Athletics parallel rolls (above) could instead be run this way, with the whole party taking exhaustion / damage on a failure or none on a success.

### Montage

Similar to a group roll, but each party member ideally makes a different kind of roll.  Lay out the general problem or challenge and then ask what each part member is doing to tackle the problem.

* Determine the DC for all rolls.  
	* This can default to DC10+prof.
	* Or DC10+proficiency die (d4 for +2, d6 for +3, d8 for +4, etc)
	* O 10+1d4! (where the d4 can keep exploding)
* If people are doing quite separate tasks that happen to use the same skill, that's okay (such as rolling Survival for foraging vs wayfinding for a long overland journey)
* If the skill rolls feel too similar, then +2 to the DC for each additional roll on the same task.  This reflects the growing difficulty of squeezing more value out of the same approach.
* Using a resource, such as a relevant item or power, might grant advantage or an automatic success for that character.
* First decide what everyone will be doing, then all can roll.

There is only a single round of rolls in a montage.

**Outcome:** As per group roll: If half or more succeed, the party succeeds.

**Examples:** 
* *Quell a mutiny of the party's crew.* Use Intimidation to exert command and force them to back down; Persuasion to help them see reason; Insight to pick out and target the primary instigators; Athletics to restrain the key players; Vehicles(water) to steer the ship into the wind or otherwise throw things into disarray, etc.  Spells like *charm person*, *hold person*, or *calm emotion* might give automatic individual successes.  On a failure, the party must resort to combat against their own crew members.
* *Traverse the arid badlands to the ruins.*  Tools(nagivator's or calligrapher's) to follow the  map to the right place; Survival to wayfind or to avoid natural dangers; Athletics to repeatedly scale the surrounding cliffs to get clear sight lines or to support lagging members; Medicine to ensure the party stays appropriately hydrated and blister-free;  Perception to find paths (roll with advantage if seeing through the eyes of a flying familiar); Diplomacy or Performance to keep the party's spirits up through the monotony; etc.

### Gauntlet

In a gauntlet, the party has determined their course and needs to simply power through the obstacles along that course. The GM calls for a series of parallel skill checks or saves representing the challenges everyone faces, with individual side-effects for each failure.

**Example:** Being swept down the freezing river, in 5 rounds.
1. STR(Athletics) to swim well enough to regularly keep your head above water (or expend one HD without benefit as a kind of fatigue)
2. DEX(Acrobatics) to avoid the rocks in the rapids (or suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage)
3. STR save to hang on to your gear in the current (or lose 1 item at random)
4. STR(Athletics) to haul yourself out of water (or you are swept further down the river over gravel to a thorny bank, suffering 1d6 slashing damage)
5. CON save to endure the cold of your wet clothes (or suffer 1 exhaustion)

**Boons (optional):** If a party member succeeds their roll by 5 or more, they can choose to either: 
+ Help another character this turn.  The helped character rolls another d20 to replace one that they rolled.
+ Gain an advantage on their roll for the next round of the gauntlet.  

**Banes (optional):** If you roll a natural 1 and fail the roll, you roll at disadvantage on the next round of the gauntlet.

### Freeform

Ideally, there's some combination of these used as appropriate to resolve actions according to the narrative.  See discussion below.

### Not Used

Above is my preferred tool set. A few other formats I've tried and ended up not liking:

##### Sequential Rolls

Some people like the "you need 3 successes to pick this lock" as a way to model a longer or more complicated task. However, what does each roll in the series represent? 

If it's just modelling time, this could be boiled down to: "It's going to take you at least 3 rounds (actions) to pick this lock".  At the end of that time, make a roll. On a failure, it takes you longer: You can try again to finish the task the following round.  

If it's modelling complexity, can you narrate that complexity to give the player more options or a sense of progress?  For example, maybe this lock has three pins that need to be aligned to open it.  Each roll represents carefully aligning one of the pins.  Knowing that then suggests other options:

* Maybe on a 20, you work fast enough to get 2 pins.  On a 1, you accidentally drop on you already aligned.
* Maybe taking each pin one at a time is three actions at DC15.  However, you could try to rake the pins into place as a single action at DC25.

In short, just making a series of the same roll over and over again is neither very fun nor tactical if it it doesn't correspond to some narrative consequence.  Each roll should feel significant or present a choice.

##### 4e Skill Challenges

4e developed a system wherein the players must earn a given number of successes before rolling 3 failures.  It's otherwise run similarly to a Montage above (and indeed this was where my Montage framework came from).

However, there are some things I don't like about 4e's version of this:

+ The "three failures" part feels rather arbitrary.  (A Montage is simply "more successes than failures".)
+ It's not clear who should participate.  Strategically, only the characters with the highest chance of success at any given allowed skill should roll that.  (A Montage requires one roll from everyone.)
+ Longer challenges tend to have things like "You can earn 4 successes from Arcana", which is a nested sequential roll.  What do each of these successes represent?

The Angry GM gives a nice rant on why [there's no such thing as a skill challenge](https://theangrygm.com/no-skill-challenges/).  The crux of it is that 4e's skill challenges (and sequential rolls) are defining the narrative problem in terms of abstract action resolution mechanics, instead of as a description of the narrative world. It breaks you out of the narrative to just roll mechanics. That can be a fine compromise for a GM-less system.  But even later versions of 4e's skill challenges recognized that they're often more fun if you could hide the fact that you're even doing a skill challenge by instead focusing on the narrative rather than the list of skills and number of successes.  Compare instead to Angry's open-ended [Whatever Stat](https://theangrygm.com/the-whatever-stat/).
