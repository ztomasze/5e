### Level 1

Feather Fall 


Goodberry (limited for survival campaigns, Teratogeny)
 "berry" > "berries": It takes all 10 to provide enough sustenance for 1 person.  This does not include hydration.

Goodberry
Cannot be squeezed into anotherâ€™s mouth. You must spend your own action to consume it. (This is the downside for getting a full 10 points of divisible healing with additional benefits.)
Provides only nourishment (food, as per bead of nourishment), not hydration. You must separately source clean drinking water.


Jump

Mage Armor
Has a duration of "adventuring day"

##### Smite spells
*This covers the 7 Smite spells: **Banishing**, **Blinding**, **Branding**, **Searing**, **Staggering**, **Thunderous**, and **Wrathful** Smite.*  *(From 2024, plus ranged option)*

+ **Casting Time:** Can be cast as a bonus action in response to hitting with a melee weapon attack. Alternatively, can be cast as a bonus action on a ranged weapon, but the effect only takes place if the next attack with that weapon made within the duration hits a target.
+ **Duration:** Does not require Concentration. If the smite has a lingering effect, it lasts for up to the full duration (1 minute).

##### Witch Bolt
* **Range:** 60'
* **Effect:** 
	* Whether the initial attack hits or not, you still form a sustained arc that you can use to automatically deal damage on future turns. 
	* You can use a bonus action (instead of an action) to deal damage on subsequent turns, but the spell ends if you fail to deal damage with it on a subsequent turn.  
* *(From 2024 - but only three of the four buffs to this spell!)*

### Level 2

Silence
Can cast (but not as a ritual) on an object, which then moves with that object.

##### Prayer of Healing
+ **Effect:** When choosing up to six targets, you can select a target more than once, up to six total applications. Each extra application to a target heals +1d8 (equivalent to casting at 1 level higher for that target).
+ (Also true in kind for: **Mass Healing Word** and **Mass Cure Wounds**.)

Ray of Sickness
Deals 3d8 (instead of 2d8) damage.
