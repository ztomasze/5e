I will apply the General Rulings to all affected spells by default.  The spell-specific details are options you can adopt as desired.

### General Rulings

2024 experimented with standardizing certain mechanics, though it still doesn't always do it consistently. Running with that idea, I'd like to standardize the following effects.  Spells are the most common source of these, but items and abilities sometimes produce them too.

(Affected spell lists focus on lower-level PHB spells and may not be complete yet.)

#### Attack augmentation spells
This covers the 7 **Smite** spells (**Banishing**, **Blinding**, **Branding**, **Searing**, **Staggering**, **Thunderous**, and **Wrathful** Smite), as well as some of the ranger spells (**Ensnaring Strike**, **Hail of Thorns**).  Rather than needing to cast them beforehand as a bonus action and concentrate until you hit, you can immediately cast them as a bonus action on hit:

+ **Casting Time:** Can be cast as a bonus action in response to hitting with a weapon attack. 
+ **Duration:** Does not require Concentration. If the spell has a lingering effect, it lasts for up to the full duration (1 minute).

**Smites:**  The smite spells only work as described with melee weapon attacks *(as per 2024)*. However, they can be cast as a bonus action when you make an attack with a ranged weapon, but the effect only takes place if the attack then hits its target.

<!-- Ensnaring Strike might want to be Concentration so you can end it early. -->

#### Breaking free of restraint
Whenever a spell allows a Strength check to break free of an restraining effect, you can use **Strength(Athletics)** as you would against a grapple.  

Affected spells:  **Ensnaring Strike**, **Entangle**, **Web**; **Evard's Black Tentacles**; etc 

#### Recurring areas of effect
For any area that causes repeated damage, save, or healing, the area should:

+ Trigger that damage or save as soon as it is cast
+ Trigger whenever a creature enters or is transported into the area
+ Trigger at the end of an affected creature's turn, if it has not yet triggered this turn
+ The area should only trigger once per turn

Affected spells (those with a * already work with way in 2014): **Grease**\*; **Cloud of Daggers**, **Cordon of Arrows**\*, **Gust of Wind**, **Moonbeam** (on later turns, the beam only damages when it stops moving), **Web**; **Sleet Storm**, **Spirit Guardians**; **Control Water** (whirlpool), **Evard's Black Tentacles**, **Wall of Fire**\*; **Cloudkill**.  Also: **Healing Spirit**.

#### Roll augmentation effects
If an effect lets you modify a given roll, such as reroll it or add a bonus to it, you first get to know whether the roll succeeds or fails.  *(This both feels better and doesn't require someone to interrupt the roll fast enough to avoid learning the result of the roll.)*

Example abilities: **Guidance**, **Resistance**; Bard's Bardic Inspiration, Cleric (War)'s Guiding Strike, etc.

#### Summon Spells from TCE
The *Summon X* spells from Tasha's are allowed with the changes:
+ **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.
+ **Effect:** You must spend a bonus action to (mentally) issue a command to the summoned creature
+ *(Like many things in Tasha's, I think these spells are a little too powerful.  The bonus action to command is on par with Unseen Servant, Animate Dead, or XGE's Tiny Servant)*

### Cantrips

#### Blade Ward
* **Range:** 30 ft
* **Effect:** (You can target other creatures.)

#### Dancing Lights
+ **Effect:** You can combine the 4 floating lights into single fist-sized source of torch-like bright light. 

#### Friends
+ **Range:** 10 ft
+ **Effect:** As per Charm Person (except for duration). You can target a given creature with this spell only once per day. 
+ *(From 2024, basically)*

<!--
This spell amplifies your goodwill. You gain advantage on Charisma checks made to deal openly and honestly with one target creature. This precludes most Deception or Intimidation checks. The creature does not automatically realize that you used magic to influence it. The creature cannot be affected by this spell again for 24 hours.
-->

<!--
Guidance, Resistance
Lasts up to 1 hour.
-->
#### Magic Stone
+ **Effect:** The damage die increases when you reach levels 5 (d8), 11 (d10), and 17 (d12). 
+ *(From 2024's Shillelagh)*

#### Shillelagh
+ **Effect:** The damage die increases when you reach levels 5 (d10), 11 (d12), and 17 (2d6). 
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Spare the Dying
+ **Range:** 15 feet. This range increases with spell level: 30' at level 5, 60' at level 11, and 120' at level 17.  
+ *(From 2024; needed a buff to compete with healer's kit)*  <!-- consider: as bonus action? -->

#### True Strike
* **Casting time:** Bonus action.  
* **Effect:** (You must still wait until your next turn to gain the advantage.)

<!--
2024 spell changes:

+ Acid Splash - deals its damage in a 5' radius sphere
+ (Blade Ward) - -1d4 damage from attack rolls on you
+ Chill Touch - Melee, d10, no undead effect
+ Guidance - Applies to a given skill for the duration, rather than a single ability check
+ Poison Spray - 30'; ranged attack instead of save; necromancy instead of conjuration
+ Produce Flame - twice as bright, twice as far (60' range); bonus to cast, action to use
+ Resistance - -1d4 damage of a given type, once per round, for 1 min
+ Shocking Grasp - (no more advantage for target being in metal armor)
+ (True Strike) - Weapon uses spellcasting ability mod and can deal radiant damage instead

New Cantrips
+ Elementalism - minor effects
+ (Mind Sliver)
+ Sorcerous Burst - d8! in 120'
+ Starry Wisp - d8 radiant in 60' and causes to glow, can't be invisible
+ (Thunderclap)
+ (Toll the Dead)

Possible TCE changes
+ Thunderclap - d8?
+ Toll the Dead - Only d10 on injured

-->

### Level 1

#### Compelled Duel
+ **Effect:** Once affected by the spell, the target cannot willing move more than 30 free away from you (no additional saves made).
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Divine Favor
+ **Duration:** No concentration required.
+ *(From 2024)

#### Feather Fall 
+ **Effect:** Alternatively, you can target one thrown weapon or fired piece of ammunition within range that you can see. That object becomes as light as a feather and deals no damage on hit. 
+ *(Reviving an effect from earlier editions to make this spell more useful.)*

#### Goodberry
+ **Effect:** A berry can be consumed as a bonus action. *(From 2024, and matches potion rule.)*
+ **Ruling:**  You must spend your own (bonus) action to consume a berry. Unlike a potion or salve, you cannot spend your action to feed or squeeze the juice of a berry into another creatures's mouth. *(This is the downside for getting a full 10 points of divisible healing with additional benefits.)*
+ **Ruling:** Provides only nourishment (food/rations, as per *bead of nourishment*), not hydration. You must separately source clean drinking water.
+ **Ruling:** Life Cleric's Discipline of Life does not apply to the berries. *(The spell creates the berries, rather than directly restoring hit points to a creature. And because the alternative is busted.)*
+ *(In certain survival-oriented campaigns, this spell may be modified to: "berry" > "berries": It takes all 10 to provide enough sustenance for 1 person.)*

#### Jump
+ **Casting time:** Bonus action
+ **Effect:** You touch a willing creature. Once on each of its turns until the spell ends, that creature can jump up to 30 feet by spending 10 feet of movement.
+ **Higher spell slot:** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
+ *(From 2024 - faster, simpler, stronger, and scales with level)*

#### Mage Armor
+ **Duration:** Treat "8 hours" as "adventuring day", which is more like 16 hours
+ **Effect:** You can cast on a creature wearing armor, but only the better AC calculation applies.
+ *(Reflects how I tend to play this spell in practice.)*

#### Ray of Sickness
+ **Effect**: On a hit, the target is automatically poisoned (no save). On a miss, the target is poisoned if they fail a CON save. 
+ *(Dropping the save on hit is from 2024. Retaining the save part as a miss effect is to reduce save-or-suck.)*

#### Searing Smite
+ **Effect:** At the start of each of the target's turns, take the 1d6 fire damage and then make the save to end the spell.
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Shield of Faith
+ **Effect:** Does not require concentration when cast on yourself.  <!-- Minimal change: "When cast on yourself, you automatically succeed Constitution saves to maintain concentration on this spell when taking damage."  But weird versus everything else. -->
+ *(It feels lame to need to make a CON save every time you get hit to keep up a spell like this that grants you armor so you can wade into battle. However, this change shouldn't let you just spam it on everyone in the party.)*

#### Witch Bolt
* **Range:** 60'
* **Effect:** 
	* Whether the initial attack hits or not, you still form a sustained arc that you can use to automatically deal damage on future turns. 
	* You can use a bonus action (instead of an action) to deal damage on subsequent turns, but the spell ends if you fail to deal damage with it on a subsequent turn.  
* *(From 2024 - but including only three of the four buffs to this spell!)*

### Level 2

#### Barkskin
+ **Casting time:** Bonus action
+ **Duration:** 1 hour (no concentration required)
+ **Effect:** AC17
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Cloud of Daggers
+ **Effect:** As an action, you can move the cube 5 feet.
+ *(From 2024, but less so)*

#### Cordon of Arrows
+ **Effect:** Each arrow deals 2d4 damage.
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Mirror Image
+ **Effect:** Instead of rolling a d20, roll a d8 with 3 images, d6 with 2 images, or d4 with 1 image. In all cases, you are hit on a 1 or 2, and an image is hit on any other result.
+ *(Easier to remember and implement at the table. Personal reason: Braum)*

<!--
choose one of these easier-to remember methods:
	1. Roll a d12. You are always the first target, then your images, so you are hit on a 1-3 with three images, 1-4 with two images, or 1-6 with one image.
	2. Roll a d4 with 3 image, d3 with 2 images, or d2 with 1 image.  You are hit on a 1; an image is hit on anything else.
using a d8, d6, d4 uses real dice (handy when not playing virtually) which you could actually put on the table next to a figure
-->

#### Prayer of Healing
+ **Effect:** When choosing up to six targets, you can select a target more than once, up to six total applications. Each extra application to a target heals +1d8 (equivalent to casting at 1 level higher for that target).
+ (Also true in kind for: **Mass Healing Word** and **Mass Cure Wounds**.)

#### Ray of Enfeeblement
+ **Effect:** Instead of making a ranged attack, the target must make a CON save: 
	+ Success: The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.
	+ Failure: In addition to dealing only half damage with Strength-based weapon attacks until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on Strength-based attacks, checks, and saves.
+ *(Incorporating 2024's changes, but keeping half STR weapon damage rather than -1d8 damage.)*

#### Silence
+ Can be cast (not as a ritual) on an object or creature (Will save negates), which then moves with that object.
+ *(Reviving an effect from earlier editions, similar to Light or Darkness)*

#### Spiritual Weapon
+ **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
+ **Effect:** You can move the weapon to anywhere within range of you.
+ *(Concentration change from 2024; movement rate from long slogs to catch up)*

<!--
2024 changes (beyond rewordings)
+ Alter Self - can use your spellcasting mod for the natural attacks
+ Animal Messenger - animal gets a save; CR0 is relevant
+ (Barkskin) - bonus action; no concentration; AC17
+ Beast Sense - You don't lose your own senses
+ Blindness/Deafness - 120' range
+ Branding Smite - Renamed to Shining Smite
+ (Cloud of Daggers) - You can teleport the cube up to 30 feet as an action. A creature takes damage (up to once per turn) if it enters the cube, the cube enters its space, or if it ends its turn in the cube.
+ (Cordon of Arrows - Deals 2d4 (instead of 1d6) damage
+ Darkvision - Grands 150' darkvision
+ Detect Thoughts - (significantly cleaned up); creature saves rather than contests to end your probing
+ Enhance Ability - dropped CON buff; only get advantage on checks with no other riders; you can choose a different effect for each additional creature
+ Enthrall - -10 to Perception (rather than just disadv)
+ Find Steed - only an action to cast; Provides a stat block (with three 1/day ability: fear, misty step, heal); when recasting, you can choose to summon the same or a different mount
+ Gust of Wind - A creature saves if it ends it turn (rather than starts)
+ Hold Person - extra targets don't need to be near each other
+ Invisibility - spell also ends if you deal damage
+ Lesser Restoration - bonus action.  Doesn't cure disease.
+ Mirror Image - Roll when you are hit (rather than determining what is hit first); then roll a d6 for each image and an image is hit of 3+ is rolled on at least one of them.
+ Moonbeam - Reverts any shapeshifted creature, including polymorph, etc.  Makes the save (only once per turn) when the area moves into its space, it enters the area, or it ends it turn there.
+ Phantasmal Force - Deals 2d8 (instead of 1d6) damage
+ Prayer of Healing - 5 creatures; also grants a short rest (once per long rest)
+ (Ray of Enfeeblement) - CON save instead of ranged attack; on fail, still gets disadvantage on its next attack; on a success, disadvantage on all STR tests and -1d8 from all damage rolls.
+ Shatter - Clarified that any construct has disadvantage

Considered changes

-->

### Level 3

#### Aura of Vitality
+ **Effect:** Instead of requiring a bonus action, you can heal when you cast the spell and once at the start of each of your turns.
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Conjure Animals
+ **Effect:** The conjured beasts act on your initiative, immediately after you.  *(To keep initiative simple and speed play)*
+ **Ruling:** All summoned beasts should be of the same type.  *(To speed play.)*
+ **Ruling:** When summoning more than one beast, successive beasts must appear in unoccupied spaces as close as possible to the first one you placed.  *(Reduces strategic optimization of large groups.)*
+ **Ruling:** The conjured beasts deal expected damage (skip any poison saves and just deal 3/4 that damage); just roll to hit. The DM may use mob rules with large packs.  *(To speed play)*
+ **Ruling:** Your verbal commands each turn must be limited to a single short sentence, such as "Attack that creature", "Defend me", "Carry us", or "Guard this hallway." You issue commands to the pack as a whole, rather than to individual creatures.  For example, if a large pack downs a designated target, any remaining attacks may be wasted that turn until you can assign them another target. With the exception of giant eagles, most beasts are not very smart. The DM is the final arbitrator of how the conjured animals interpret your commands.  *(You cannot easily optimize a large pack's movement and target selection.)*
+ **Ruling:** You are initially limited to summoning beasts that appear in Appendix D of the PHB (plus a few CR 2 creatures provided below).  Other beasts might be added to your roster through play.

| CR  | Beasts                                                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | bat, cat, frog, hawk, owl, rat, raven                         |
| 1/8 | mastiff, mule, poisonous snake                                |
| 1/4 | boar, constrictor snake, panther, riding horse, wolf          |
| 1/2 | black bear, crocodile, reef shark, warhorse                   |
| 1   | brown bear, dire wolf, giant eagle, giant spider, lion, tiger |
| 2   | (cave bear, giant constrictor snake, hunter shark)            |

#### Conjure Barrage
+ **Effect:** Deals 5d8 force damage.
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Daylight
+ **Effect:**  If cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the light counts as sunlight.
+ *(From 2024, but less so)*

#### Spirit Guardians
+ **Effect:**  You do not need to currently see a creature to designate it as unaffected. *(From 2024)*
+ **Effect:** Whenever a creature would take damage from this spell, you can add it to those creatures you've designated as unaffected by this spell. *(Generally how we play it at the table)*

<!--
Would really like to drop the movement reduction, or at least convert it to difficult terrain, because this spell is so strong, but...
-->
