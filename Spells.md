**Strength(Athletics):** Whenever a spell allows a Strength check to break free of an restraining effect, you can apply any Athletics proficiency as you would against a grapple.  Sample spells:  Ensnaring Strike; Entangle; Web; Evard's Black Tentacles; etc  *(From 2024)*




You may choose to apply the changes given for each spell below.

### Cantrips

#### Blade Ward

+ **Range:** 10 ft
+ **Effect:** As per Charm Person (except for duration). You can target a given creature with this spell only once per day. 
+ *(From 2024, basically)*

<!--
This spell amplifies your goodwill. You gain advantage on Charisma checks made to deal openly and honestly with one target creature. This precludes most Deception or Intimidation checks. The creature does not automatically realize that you used magic to influence it. The creature cannot be affected by this spell again for 24 hours.
-->

<!--
Guidance, Resistance
Lasts up to 1 hour.
-->
#### Magic Stone
+ **Effect:** The damage die increases when you reach levels 5 (d8), 11 (d10), and 17 (d12). 
+ *(From 2024's Shillelagh)*

#### Shillelagh

+ *(From 2024)*

#### Spare the Dying
+ **Range:** 15 feet. This range increases with spell level: 30' at level 5, 60' at level 11, and 120' at level 17.  
+ *(From 2024; needed a buff to compete with healer's kit)*  <!-- consider: as bonus action? -->

#### True Strike
* **Casting time:** Bonus action.  
* **Effect:** (You must still wait until your next turn to gain the advantage.)

<!--

+ Acid Splash - deals its damage in a 5' radius sphere
+ (Blade Ward) - -1d4 damage from attack rolls on you
+ Chill Touch - Melee, d10, no undead effect
+ Guidance - Applies to a given skill for the duration, rather than a single ability check
+ Poison Spray - 30'
+ Produce Flame - twice as bright, twice as far (60' range); bonus to cast, action to use
+ Resistance - -1d4 damage of a given type, once per round, for 1 min
+ Shocking Grasp - (no more advantage for target being in metal armor)

-->

### Level 1

#### Compelled Duel
+ **Effect:** Once affected by the spell, the target cannot willing move more than 30 free away from you (no additional saves made).
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Divine Favor
+ **Duration:** No concentration required.
+ *(From 2024)

#### Feather Fall 
+ **Effect:** Alternatively, you can target one thrown weapon or fired piece of ammunition within range that you can see. That object becomes as light as a feather and deals no damage on hit. 
+ *(Reviving an effect from earlier editions to make this spell more useful.)*

#### Goodberry
+ **Effect:** A berry can be consumed as a bonus action. *(From 2024, and matches potion rule.)*
+ **Ruling:**  You must spend your own (bonus) action to consume a berry. Unlike a potion or salve, you cannot spend your action to feed or squeeze the juice of a berry into another creatures's mouth. *(This is the downside for getting a full 10 points of divisible healing with additional benefits.)*
+ **Ruling:** Provides only nourishment (food/rations, as per *bead of nourishment*), not hydration. You must separately source clean drinking water.
+ **Ruling:** Life Cleric's Discipline of Life does not apply to the berries. *(The spell creates the berries, rather than directly restoring hit points to a creature. And because the alternative is busted.)*
+ *(In certain survival-oriented campaigns, this spell may be modified to: "berry" > "berries": It takes all 10 to provide enough sustenance for 1 person.)*

#### Jump
+ **Casting time:** Bonus action
+ **Effect:** You touch a willing creature. Once on each of its turns until the spell ends, that creature can jump up to 30 feet by spending 10 feet of movement.
+ **Higher spell slot:** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
+ *(From 2024 - faster, simpler, stronger, and scales with level)*

#### Mage Armor
+ **Duration:** Treat "8 hours" as "adventuring day", which is more like 16 hours
+ **Effect:** You can cast on a creature wearing armor, but only the better AC calculation applies.
+ *(Reflects how I tend to play this spell in practice.)*

#### Ray of Sickness
+ **Effect**: On a hit, the target is automatically poisoned (no save). On a miss, the target is poisoned if they fail a CON save. 
+ *(Dropping the save on hit is from 2024. Retaining the save part as a miss effect is to reduce save-or-suck.)*

#### Shield of Faith
+ **Effect:** Does not require concentration when cast on yourself.  <!-- Minimal change: "When cast on yourself, you automatically succeed Constitution saves to maintain concentration on this spell when taking damage."  But weird versus everything else. -->
+ *(It feels lame to need to make a CON save every time you get hit to keep up a spell like this that grants you armor so you can wade into battle. However, this change shouldn't let you just spam it on everyone in the party.)*

#### Smite spells
*This covers the 7 Smite spells: **Banishing**, **Blinding**, **Branding**, **Searing**, **Staggering**, **Thunderous**, and **Wrathful** Smite.*  *(From 2024, plus ranged option)*

+ **Casting Time:** Can be cast as a bonus action in response to hitting with a melee weapon attack. Alternatively, can be cast as a bonus action when you make an attack with a ranged weapon, but the effect only takes place if the attack hits its target.
+ **Duration:** Does not require Concentration. If the smite has a lingering effect, it lasts for up to the full duration (1 minute).
+ ***Searing Smite:*** At the start of each of the target's turns, take the 1d6 fire damage and then make the save to end the spell.

#### Witch Bolt
* **Range:** 60'
* **Effect:** 
	* Whether the initial attack hits or not, you still form a sustained arc that you can use to automatically deal damage on future turns. 
	* You can use a bonus action (instead of an action) to deal damage on subsequent turns, but the spell ends if you fail to deal damage with it on a subsequent turn.  
* *(From 2024 - but including only three of the four buffs to this spell!)*

Added spells
+ Ice Knife

Considered changes

-->

### Level 2

#### Barkskin
+ **Casting time:** Bonus action
+ **Duration:** 1 hour (no concentration required)
+ **Effect:** AC17
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Cloud of Daggers
+ **Effect:** A creature takes damage when the cube enters its space for the first time on a turn, when the creature enters the cube for the first time on a turn, or when the creature ends its turn in the cube. As an action, you can move the cube 5 feet.
+ *(From 2024, but with less repositioning)*

#### Cordon of Arrows
+ **Effect:** Each arrow deals 2d4 damage.
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Mirror Image
+ **Effect:** Roll a d12 (instead of d20), as it is more easily divisible & memorable.  You are always the first target, then your images, so you are hit on a 1-3 with three images, 1-4 with two images, or 1-6 with one image.
+ *(Personal reason: Braum)*

#### Prayer of Healing
+ **Effect:** When choosing up to six targets, you can select a target more than once, up to six total applications. Each extra application to a target heals +1d8 (equivalent to casting at 1 level higher for that target).
+ (Also true in kind for: **Mass Healing Word** and **Mass Cure Wounds**.)

#### Ray of Enfeeblement
+ **Effect:** Instead of making a ranged attack, the target must make a CON save: 
	+ Success: The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.
	+ Failure: In addition to dealing only half damage with Strength-based weapon attacks until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on Strength-based attacks, checks, and saves.
+ *(Incorporating 2024's changes, but keeping half STR weapon damage rather than -1d8 damage.)*

#### Silence
+ Can be cast (not as a ritual) on an object or creature (Will save negates), which then moves with that object.
+ *(Reviving an effect from earlier editions, similar to Light or Darkness)*

#### Spiritual Weapon
+ **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Web
+ **Effect:** Creatures make a save versus being restrained when the spell is cast, when they first enter the area on a turn (voluntarily or not), and when they end their turn in the area.
+ *(I've long seen creatures being fully unrestrained until their turn as a problem with this spell, since it can't grant attack advantage on targets or inhibit their OAs in the meantime.  2024 updates some spells like Gust of Wind and Moonbeam by moving saves from the start of turn to the end, so applying the same idea here for Web.)*

<!--
2024 changes (beyond rewordings)

+ Gust of Wind - A creature saves if it ends it turn (rather than starts)
+ Hold Person - extra targets don't need to be near each other

+ Mirror Image - Roll when you are hit (rather than determining what is hit first); then roll a d6 for each image and an image is hit of 3+ is rolled on at least one of them.
+ Moonbeam - Reverts any shapeshifted creature, including polymorph, etc.  Makes the save (only once per turn) when the area moves into its space, it enters the area, or it ends it turn there.
+ Phantasmal Force - Deals 2d8 (instead of 1d6) damage
+ Prayer of Healing - 5 creatures; also grants a short rest (once per long rest)
+ (Ray of Enfeeblement) - CON save instead of ranged attack; on fail, still gets disadvantage on its next attack; on a success, disadvantage on all STR tests and -1d8 from all damage rolls.
+ Shatter - Clarified that any construct has disadvantage
+ (Spiritual Weapon) - concentration
+ Suggestion - limited to 25 words; can't suggest anything that would damage the target's allies either

+ **Effect:** Creatures act on your turn, immediately after you.
+ **Ruling:** Beasts are generally dumb. Each turn, you can issue a short one-sentence command to all summoned creatures or a command to one of them.

#### Spirit Guardians
+ **Effect:**  You do not need to see a creature to designate it as unaffected. *(From 2024)*
+ **Effect:** Whenever a creature would take damage from this spell, you can add it to those creatures you've designated as unaffected by this spell. *(Generally how we play it at the table)*
+ **Effect:** **Does not halve creatures' speed** in the area.
+ *(I have a hard time remembering this effect in battle, and I think this spell is strong enough without it.)*
