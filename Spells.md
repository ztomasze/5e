<!--
This spell amplifies your goodwill. You gain advantage on Charisma checks made to deal openly and honestly with one target creature. This precludes most Deception or Intimidation checks. The creature does not automatically realize that you used magic to influence it. The creature cannot be affected by this spell again for 24 hours.
-->

<!--
Guidance, Resistance
Lasts up to 1 hour.
-->

+ *(From 2024; needed a buff to compete with healer's kit)*  <!-- consider: as bonus action? -->

#### True Strike

* **Effect:** (You must still wait until your next turn to gain the advantage.)

### Level 1

#### Compelled Duel
+ **Effect:** Once affected by the spell, the target cannot willing move more than 30 free away from you (no additional saves made).
+ *(From 2024)*

#### Divine Favor
+ **Duration:** Concentration is not required.
+ *(From 2024)

#### Feather Fall 
+ **Effect:** Alternatively, target one thrown weapon or fired piece of ammunition (within range). That object becomes as light as a feather and deals no damage on hit. 
+ *(Reviving an effect from earlier editions to make this spell more useful.)*

#### Goodberry
+ **Effect:** A berry can be consumed as a bonus action. *(From 2024, and matches potion rule.)*
+ **Ruling:**  You must spend your own (bonus) action to consume a berry. Unlike a potion or salve, you cannot spend your action to feed or squeeze the juice of a berry into another creatures's mouth. *(This is the downside for getting a full 10 points of divisible healing with additional benefits.)*
+ **Ruling:** Provides only nourishment (food/rations, as per *bead of nourishment*), not hydration. You must separately source clean drinking water.
+ **Ruling:** Life Cleric's Discipline of Life does not apply to the berries. *(The spell creates the berries, rather than directly restoring hit points to a creature. And because the alternative is busted.)*
+ *(In certain survival-oriented campaigns, this spell may be modified to: "berry" > "berries": It takes all 10 to provide enough sustenance for 1 person.)*

#### Jump
+ **Casting time:** Bonus action
+ **Effect:** You touch a willing creature. Once on each of its turns until the spell ends, that creature can jump up to 30 feet by spending 10 feet of movement.
+ **Higher spell slot:** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
+ *(From 2024 - faster, simpler, stronger, and scales with level)*

#### Mage Armor
+ **Duration:** Treat "8 hours" as "adventuring day", which is more like 16 hours
+ **Effect:** You can cast on a creature wearing armor, but only the better AC calculation applies.

#### Ray of Sickness
+ **Effect**: On a hit, the target is automatically poisoned (no save). On a miss, the target is poisoned if they fail a CON save. 
+ *(Dropping the save on hit is from 2024. Retaining the save part as a miss effect helps reduce the save-or-suck.)*

#### Shield of Faith
+ **Effect:** When cast on yourself, you automatically succeed Constitution saves to maintain concentration on this spell when taking damage.  <!-- minimal change - still requires concentration, even on self.  Should probably auto-save only be vs weapon attacks, and not area effects, etc, but too hard to remember that additional distinction -->

#### Smite spells
*This covers the 7 Smite spells: **Banishing**, **Blinding**, **Branding**, **Searing**, **Staggering**, **Thunderous**, and **Wrathful** Smite.*  *(From 2024, plus ranged option)*

+ **Casting Time:** Can be cast as a bonus action in response to hitting with a melee weapon attack. Alternatively, can be cast as a bonus action when you make an attack with a ranged weapon, but the effect only takes place if the attack hits its target.
+ **Duration:** Does not require Concentration. If the smite has a lingering effect, it lasts for up to the full duration (1 minute).
+ ***Searing Smite:*** At the start of each of the target's turns, take the 1d6 fire damage and then make the save to end the spell.

#### Witch Bolt
* **Range:** 60'
* **Effect:** 
	* Whether the initial attack hits or not, you still form a sustained arc that you can use to automatically deal damage on future turns. 
	* You can use a bonus action (instead of an action) to deal damage on subsequent turns, but the spell ends if you fail to deal damage with it on a subsequent turn.  
* *(From 2024 - but including only three of the four buffs to this spell!)*

### Level 2

#### Prayer of Healing
+ **Effect:** When choosing up to six targets, you can select a target more than once, up to six total applications. Each extra application to a target heals +1d8 (equivalent to casting at 1 level higher for that target).
+ (Also true in kind for: **Mass Healing Word** and **Mass Cure Wounds**.)

#### Ray of Enfeeblement
+ **Effect:** Instead of making a ranged attack, the target must make a CON save: 
	+ Success: The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.
	+ Failure: In addition to dealing only half damage with Strength-based weapon attacks until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on Strength-based attacks, checks, and saves.
+ *(Incorporating 2024's changes, but keeping half weapon damage rather than -1d8 damage.)*

#### Silence
+ Can be cast (not as a ritual) on an object or creature (Will save negates), which then moves with that object.
+ *(Reviving an effect from earlier editions, similar to Light or Darkness)*

#### Spiritual Weapon
+ **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
+ *(From 2024)*

<!--
Barkskin
-->

### Level 3

#### Spirit Guardians
+ **Effect:**  You do not need to see a creature to designate it as unaffected. *(From 2024)*
+ **Effect:** Whenever a creature would take damage from this spell, you can add it to those creatures you've designated as unaffected by this spell. *(Generally how we play it at the table)*
+ **Effect:** **Does not halve creatures' speed** in the area.
