Doubles on Adv/Disadv rolls
Except for the case of double 1s, you can choose to reroll one of the dice.


Inspiration: HD variant (most solo)
Gain no inspiration points.  Instead, after rolling a d20 but before the results are declared, you can spend 1 HD to take 10 on the roll.
If you had adv or disadv, this "take 10" applies to only the higher or lower die, respectively, though you can spend a second HD to set the second die as well (ie, might take 2 uses if both dice are less than 10 on disadv).
If you roll a 1, it takes 2 HD to set it to a 10.  (If on a death save, can take one fail and lose one HD to reroll.)

Largely switched this over to 7+d6 instead of take 10.


Save or Die
There are still a few save-or-die effects around, such as petrify, disintegrate, etc.  Also, massive damage.  Feels harsh vs normal death rules. One way to cushion these is:
Drop to 0 hp and take 2 fails (as for a crit hit).
Still dying, so you'll have to make that last save on your turn.
(Also a lasting injury?)
