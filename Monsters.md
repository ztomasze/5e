#### Swarms

* Swarms take a max of 1 point of damage per weapon attack. This is the case even if the weapon is magical. Any additional damage of another type, such as the fire damage from a flaming sword, applies normally.
* Swarms are vulnerable to any damage dealt by an effect that allows a DEX save for half damage.

*(Implemented for verisimilitude, since I just can't visualize how a fighter kills half a swarm with one arrow or single sword swing. Also harkens back to older editions. The added vulnerability is a nod to the fact that the swarm is many tiny individuals, susceptible to an area effect.  Burning oil, acid, alchemistâ€™s fire, and magic are the best way to destroy swarms!)*
