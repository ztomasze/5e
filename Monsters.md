Monster: Swarms
Weapon attacks deal only 1 damage to swarms.
Swarms are vulnerable to any damage dealt by an effect that allows a DEX save for half damage.

Swarms take a max of 1 point of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage per attack. This is the case even if the weapon is magical. Any additional damage of another type, such as the fire damage from a flaming sword, applies normally. (Burning oil, acid, alchemistâ€™s fire, and magic are the best way to destroy swarms!)
