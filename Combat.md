### Actions

##### Bonus Action as Action
You can choose to use your action to perform a bonus action that is available to you.  This means you can Ready a bonus action, for example.

##### Object interactions
* You can perform a second object interaction on your turn as a bonus action.
* **Juggling an object.** If you could accomplish a task, such as opening a door while carrying a sword and shield, by dropping an item as a free action, performing the task as an action or bonus action, and then using an object interaction to recover the dropped item, then I will usually let you spend your object interaction to do this without actually dropping the item.  For example, maybe you quickly sheathe your sword, or tuck it under your arm, or transfer it briefly to your shield hand, while you open the door. 

### Movement

##### Difficult Terrain
The spaces of other creatures are difficult terrain even if they are prone, unconscious, or dead (unless they are 2 sizes or more smaller than you).

### Combat Actions

##### Unarmed strikes
You can use DEX to make an unarmed strike, but you do not then apply your DEX to damage unless it is negative. This also applies to any natural weapon attacks, such as claws or bite.

##### Combat Maneuvers
There's a few more options you can do than just grab or shove.

* All of these maneuvers may incur advantage or disadvantage on one side of the contest depending on the specific context--such as as a human trying to grapple a otyugh, an elf trying to trip a displacer beast, a dwarf trying to tumble past a gelatinous cube in a narrow corridor, etc.

| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **disarm**               | DMG    | Resolve as per grapple, but the attacker uses a weapon attack roll in the contest. The defender has advantage if they are holding the item with two hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **grapple** (grab)       | PHB    | The **default** meaning of grapple, as described in the PHB.<br><br>+When a larger or tentacled grappler is forcibly moved away from a smaller creature it is grappling, it may get to make a DC15 STR check to keep its grip and drag that creature it with.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **grapple** (climb onto) | DMG    | You can try to grab onto a creature that is larger than you. Resolve as per grapple (restrain).  Rather than restraining the creature, you simply cling onto it, moving with it as it moves. You may be able to climb higher onto the creature if using two hands. A sufficiently large creature can pull or knock you off as a bonus action; a creature that is only one size larger may need to make a grapple check to do so. |
| **grapple** (restrain)   | Custom | Whenever you could attempt to grapple (grab) a target, you can attempt to restrain it instead. Resolve as per grapple, but you must either use two free hands or make your check at disadvantage.  On a success, both you and the creature you've grappled are restrained.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **overrun**              | DMG    | Can be attempted as a bonus action. Resolve as per grapple vs STR only. On a success, you can move through the defender's space once this turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **shove** (aside)        | DMG    | As shove (push), but the attacker rolls at disadvantage.  On a success, you can push the target 5 feet to a different space within your reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **shove** (push)         | PHB    | As described in the PHB, when you choose to push the target 5' back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **shove** (trip)         | PHB    | As described in the PHB, when you choose to knock the target prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **tackle**               | Custom | Resolve as grapple(restrain). Regardless of the result, you end up prone in the defender's space.  On a success, the defender is also prone and restrained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **tumble**               | DMG    | Can be attempted as a bonus action. Resolve as an Acrobatics contest. On a success, you can move through the defender's space once this turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

##### Special Actions

Some additional actions you can take in combat.

| Action        | Type           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delay**     | free (special) | At the start of your turn while in initiative order, you can choose to set your initiative to a different value and instead take your turn the next time that initiative value comes up. Any "start of your turn" or "end of your turn" effects still happen at the time that you delay. Any negative turn-based effects occur again on your delayed turn.                                                                  |
| **Flee**      | special        | When you take either the Dash or Disengage action and move away from the current battle, you can declare that you are fleeing. You can immediately make a free Dash action. You then drop out of initiative (to the end of the round) and gain the Frightened condition of all enemies still in initiative order. Enemies can choose to flee the battle to chase you.  You cannot flee if you are prone or your speed is 0. |
| **Influence** | bonus          | While speaking a sentence or two is a free action, giving it enough weight to attempt to convince, intimidate, or otherwise influence another creature requires a bonus action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Potion**    | bonus / action | You can drink a held potion as a bonus action. It takes an action to feed a potion to another creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Search**    | bonus          | Peering around the battlefield to attempt to actively locate a hidden creature, to look for footprints appearing in the sand, to guess a creature's intent or motivation, or to otherwise give your close attention to something for a couple seconds requires a bonus action.                                                                                                                                              |

*(A few useful actions imported from 2024 and 3.5e. Adding a custom flee mechanic.)*

### Cover

When playing on a grid, resolve this as per DMG, which is summarized well [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlCzJGDvkT0):  Trace lines from any corner of your square to four corners of any one of the target's squares.  If 1 or 2 line are blocked, they have half cover. If 3 or 4 are blocked but they can still be hit, three-quarters cover.

Creatures typically don’t grant more than three-quarters cover (unless the covering creature is large or thick enough to fill a 5' cube). Shooting between two creatures is typically half cover.

### Damage

##### Critical Hits
While a natural 20 on an attack roll always hits, it is only a critical hit if the roll is also high enough to hit the target’s AC.

Critical hits do a minimum of your normal max damage (including any dice from sneak attack, smite, etc). Any extra critical-hit dice (such as from the half-orc's Savage Attacks) are then rolled (with no minimum value) and added separately.

##### Falling Unconscious (0 HP)
Each time you drop to 0 hp and fall unconscious, **gain 1 exhaustion**. 

##### Nonlethal damage
This can only be done with bludgeoning melee weapons or weapons with flat blades. You can also attack non-lethally with a sheathed, padded, or leather-wrapped weapon, including a sap or leather-bound sling stones.

### Mounted Combat

On a grid, you take up the same space as a Medium or Large mount. If your mount is particularly tall or towering, I may determine that there is effectively 5 (or more) feet between the rider and an adjacent target.  For example, a swarm of snakes or a prone orc is typically out of reach from the top of a warhorse (although the rider is also out of reach of them in return). Attacks with a spear or quarterstaff can ignore the first 5 feet of this towering distance.

##### Heavy weapons
While mounted, you are at disadvantage on attacks made with heavy weapons (either ranged or melee).  *(From a campaign rule implemented for verisimilitude.)*

### Underwater combat

* **Melee attacks** are at disadvantage unless it is a stabbing (and thus usually piercing) weapon or the attacker has a swim speed.
* **Ranged attacks** - projectile weapons and nets have a 5/10' range; slings and thrown weapons cannot be used.
* *(Inspired by 2024's version, this is a streamlined version of 2024's rules that keeps the same basic form. Range shortened because even most gun bullets can't go more than 10 feet through water.)*
