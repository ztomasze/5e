#### Exhaustion

The effect is cumulative. For each level of exhaustion you have:

* -2 to ability checks, attacks, and saves
* -5 feet to speed

If you ever have 6 levels of exhaustion, you die. Finishing a long rest removes one level of exhaustion.

**Short rest:** If you are not diseased or otherwise limited in your ability to recover from exhaustion, you can remove one level of exhaustion at the end of a short rest. You can only do this once per long rest.

*(This is 2024's version of Exhaustion, plus a merging of a long-running "easier to recover from" Fatigue house rule.)*
