*Volo's Guide to Monster* (VGM) is the default source for non-PHB races. (The reprinted races in *Mordenkainen Present: Monsters of the Multiverse* (MPMM) might occasionally be pilfered for options or minor buffs.)

The lineage option for races is used in some campaigns where racial choices are limited.

Below are some specific racial tweaks:

#### Astral Elf
An astral elf should gain either +2/+1 or +1/+1/+1 bonuses spread between DEX, INT, WIS, or CHA.

#### Giff
A giff should gain +2 STR and +1 CON.

+ Remove **Astral Spark**.
+ Add **Headbutt Charge:** If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line before succeeding on a Shove attack, you deal 1d4+STR bludgeoning damage as an unarmed strike (headbutt) to that target.
+ Add **Natural Armor:** You have thick, leathery skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
+ *(As per 2e and 3e lore. Natural armor specifics from Loxodon.)*

#### Kobold
**Pack Tactics:** Spend a **bonus action** to gain advantage on your next attack roll this turn against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.  *(Unlimited pack tactics is too strong, especially given that the sunlight sensitivity limitation is often cleverly negated or avoided.)*
