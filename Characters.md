> Combines PHB's Chapter 1 (Creating a Character), Chapter 4 (Personality and Background), and part of Chapter 6 (Multiclassing)

### Level Up

On any level up, any character can replace any of these features (except if gained through their race):

* one class skill to a different one
* one skill that gains the benefit of Expertise to a different one (but not to a skill you just gained through a swap allowed above)
* one feat
* one cantrip
* one fighting style
* one battle master maneuver
* one totem spirit (barbarian)
* one favored enemy (ranger)
* one favored terrain (ranger)
* one metamagic option (sorcerer)
* one pact boon (warlock)

*(It's nice to have some flexibility in your character over time. While I considered holding out for an ASI-level for some of these, it typically takes weeks to months to reach the next single level increase in most of my campaigns. Holding out for 4 levels would be forever.)*

### Inspiration

All players are granted inspiration at the start of each gaming session.

* RAW: Players can award theirs to each other (with a Help or similar action) 

You can spend your inspiration **before a roll** to:

* Gain advantage (RAW)  (+if you already have adv, you can add a 3rd d20)
* Take 15 (or 3/4 of max value, round up, such as on damage). If you have adv/disadv: +5/-5 to the 15

Or you can spend inspiration **after a roll** to:

* Reroll (including any additional adv/disadv d20 dice)
* Take 10 (or 1/2 of max value). If you have adv/disadv: +5/-5 to the 10

You can spend your inspiration to recover one HD.
