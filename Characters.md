### Inspiration

All players are granted inspiration at the start of each gaming session.

* RAW: Players can award theirs to each other (with a Help or similar action) 

You can spend your inspiration before a roll to:
* Gain advantage (RAW)  (+: if you already have adv, you can add a 3rd d20)
* Take 15 (or 3/4 of max value, round up, such as on dmg). If you have adv/disadv: +5/-5 to the 15

Or you can spend inspiration after a roll to:
* Reroll (including any adv/disadv d20 dice)
* Take 10 (or 1/2 of max value).  If you have adv/disadv: +5/-5 to the 10
