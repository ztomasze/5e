## Magic Items

#### Identifying A Magic Item

As RAW in DMG (p136): A short rest spent attuning with a single object will let you know what it does (although this can expose you to any curses). This method assumes you're doing some experimentation during the short rest, but glosses over the details. It may not reveal all the properties of a magic item (DM's discretion).

Magical potions only take a little taste (although this can expose you to poisons, etc).

The *identify* spell is still useful for 1) its speed (versus a short rest), 2) finding curses and hidden additional powers, and 3) examining or decoding complex magical effects, such as portals, unusual artifacts, latent magical effects, etc.

Objects may have a "faint aura" if they have been shaped by magic, act as a regular conduit for magic, or have absorbed ancient or latent magical effects.  Faint auras may have no discernable school (without Identify) and cannot be detected through a barrier (only examination with direct line of sight).

Any herbal potions (ie, craftable with an herbalism kit) are mundane and so do not have a strong magical aura.  These do have a fairly standard core color/odor/taste, though, and so are pretty recognizable, despite some individual variation on the details.

<!--
+ potion of healing - pink to red, rather milky, with an almond/cherry/amaretto flavor (tho some may have a bitter or chalky aftertaste)
+ greasy healing salve - looks like pale pink vaseline, with a cherry-cinnamon-eucalyptus odor (heals like potion of healing)
+ sticky healing salve - thicker and tackier than greasy salve, with a pale blue-to-green tinge, smells like menthol playdough (each application heals 1 hp)
+ antitoxin - black and viscous liquid, with a smoky/charcoal anise/licorice smell
