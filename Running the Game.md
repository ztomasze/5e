<!--
Theater of the Mind targeting rules 
(mostly RAW, from DMG, p249)
Round up in all cases
cone: length / 10
cube/square: len / 5
cylinder: rad / 5
line: len / 30
sph/circle: rad / 5
Then roll 1dF to see if you need to add or  remove one.  If there are lots of party members nearby and want to avoid them in the area, -1 to the dF.
