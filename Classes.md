Changes:

* *(From 2024)*

##### Path: Berserker
**Frenzy (lvl 3):** When you enter a frenzied rage, you can choose to suffer the effects of Reckless Attack for the duration of that rage. If you do so, you do not suffer exhaustion at the end of the rage. *(Inspired by 2024, but keeping the original benefit)*

**Intimidating Presence (lvl 10):** If you are raging, this can be performed as a bonus action, initially and on subsequent turns.  This can be the same bonus action that you use to enter or prolong your rage. *(Inspired by 2024 and its general Influence action.)*

##### Path: Totem Warrior
**Totem Spirit: Bear (lvl 3):**  Grants resistance only to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder, but **not to force, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage**.  *(From 2024, because this totem otherwise tends to dominate over all totems and even other paths.)*

1. *detect magic* for *identify*

**War God's Blessing (lvl 6):** Replace with:
+ You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast *shield of faith* or *spiritual weapon* without expending a spell slot.  When you cast the spell this way, it does not require Concentration. The spell lasts for its full duration, but it ends early if you cast the spell again, are incapacitated, or die. *(From 2024)*

### Fighter

##### Allowed TCE Options

##### Archetype: Champion

**Improved Second Wind (+lvl 3):** When you use your Second Wind, you regain additional hit points equal to your CON modifier (min: 0).

**Remarkable Athlete (lvl 7):** Replace with:
* You gain proficiency with Athletics. If you already have proficiency, you gain expertise instead.  (If you already have expertise, gain advantage.)
* Immediately after you use your Second Wind or score a critical hit, you can move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
* *(Inspired by 2024)*


### Monk

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Dedicated Weapon (lvl 2)
+ Ki-Fueled Attack (lvl 3)
+ Quickened Healing (lvl 4)

##### Deflect Missiles (lvl 3)
Rename to **Deflect Attacks**. You can also deflect melee weapon attacks. If you reduce the damage to 0 and pay 1 ki to redirect a melee weapon attack, you must target another creature within 5' of you. For either a ranged or melee attack, resolve the redirected attack as if for a martial arts (unarmed or equivalent monk weapon) attack.  *(From 2024, mostly)*

##### Stunning Strike (lvl 5)
If the target succeeds its CON save, it still suffers an effect: Its speed is halved and it cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn. *(Inspired by 2024)*

##### Way: Shadow

+ Additional Fighting Style options

##### Harness Divine Power (lvl 2)
As an **action**, you can expend a use of Channel Divinity to regain a **level 1 spell slot**. You can do this once per long rest. *(From TCE, but slower and the spell level doesn't scale)*

##### Divine Smite (lvl 2)
This **requires a bonus action**, which can be performed upon hitting a creature with a melee weapon attack.  (See also: [Spells](Spells.md): Smite)  Alternatively, you can spend a bonus action to imbue your next ranged weapon attack with a smite.  However, on a miss, the smite is wasted.  *(Change to a bonus action comes from 2024; range option comes from a past house rule. Personal reason for switching to bonus action: "bag of beans' mummy lord")*

##### Oath: Devotion
**Channel Divinity (lvl 3): Sacred Weapon.** You can do this as a bonus action.  *(Personal reason: "Angel")*

##### Favored Enemy (lvl 1)
Add:
* Add your proficiency bonus to weapon damage rolls dealt to your favored enemies.
* As part of a level up, you may replaced one favored enemy type with another.  You must have fought and learned more about this new favored enemy during your adventures. You cannot change any associated language that you have learned, but, if your first favored enemy choice did not give you a language, you can choose one now.

##### Natural Explorer (lvl 1)
- You gain these additional movement benefits while in one of your favored terrains:
	- You can ignore non-magical difficult terrain (as per the first half of lvl 8's Land Stride).
	- You can Hide as a bonus Action
	- You have advantage on initiative rolls
- As part of a level up, you may replace one favored terrain with another that you have explored during your adventures.

##### Spellcasting (lvl 2)
You can prepare your spells, choosing to replace any of them each long rest, like a druid or paladin.

##### Primeval Awareness (lvl 3)
Optionally, instead of spending a spell slot, you can spend 1 minute in uninterrupted concentration to sense the presence of any favored enemies (only).

##### Land's Stride (lvl 8)
Add: You can Dash as a bonus Action.

##### Ambusher (+lvl 9)
+ You have advantage on initiative rolls (regardless of the current terrain)
+ On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.

##### Hide in Plain Sight (lvl 10)
*Replace with:* You can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself befitting the local environment and infusing it with the powers of nature. You must have access to a disguise kit or to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once camouflaged, you can attempt to hide even if you are only lightly obscured by natural phenomena (such as foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, or mist) or if you are up against a solid surface as tall and wide as you.  When you hide while camouflaged, you automatically become invisible (no roll needed) for as long as you remain motionless.

##### Natural Explorer Improvement (lvl 10)
You can select from any of these additional favored terrains that you have adventured in: dungeon, planar (specific plane), urban.

##### Favored Enemy Improvement (lvl 14)
Add: You gain advantage on saving throws against the innate spells and abilities of any non-humanoid favored enemies. 

##### Archetype: Beast Master

----
#todo
+ Compare to Artificer's steel defender
+ Compare to actual animals
+ Break out different attack options and build a table

**Primeval Companion (lvl 3):** *(The original Ranger's Companion feels weak and also hard to balance over all possible animals. TCE's Primal Companion is good if you want an obviously magical summon. The following Primeval Companion option attempts to blend the two to retain the original's realism and various animal options while also incorporating TCE's buffs, simplicity, and scaling.)*

Starting with TCE's Primal Companion, make the following changes:
+ You form a bond with a natural creature (beast), although your magical bond subtly augments the creature. (The beast lacks primal markings.)
+ To form a new bond, you can spend a short rest with a creature that is not hostile to you. Alternatively, you can spend a long rest to summon a native creature from the natural wilds around you.
+ When you spend a spell slot to restore your beast companion to life, it receives only 1 hp.  However, it can spend HD during a short rest to recover HP, and it recovers all HP over a long rest.
+ Your bond ends if you die. You can also end your bond over a short or long rest. When a bond ends, the creature returns to the local wilds. If you later summon a native creature again in the same area, you can choose to recall a previously bonded companion.

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. The beast is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Choose its stat block—Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky—which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its mystical origin.

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

When you finish a long rest, you can summon a different primal beast. The new beast appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when the new beast appears. The beast also vanishes if you die.

+ Additional Metamagic Options (lvl 3)
	+ Seeking Spell only costs +1 sorcery point *(From 2024)*

##### Spellcasting (lvl 1)
A Sorcerer Origin gives you list of origin spells: One or two spells for each spell level between 1 and 5. If any of these origin spells are not sorcerer spells, you can add them to your class spell list, meaning that you can learn and cast them as sorcerer spells.  When you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of the given spell level, choose one of the origin spells provided for that spell level. You add that chosen spell to your spells known.  You cannot replace that spell when you level up, except if you swap it for another spell of the same level from your origin spell list.

##### Innate Sorcery (+lvl 1)
As a bonus action, you can unleash an aura of raw magic for 1 minute. This always creates a visual effect around you, such as a spectral fire, swirling mists, flickering shadows, glowing eyes, crackling cold, etc. During this minute:
+ The spell save DC of your sorcerer spells increases by 1
+ You have advantage on the attack rolls of sorcerer spells you cast
You can use this feature once per long rest. *(From 2024, half as often, plus a visual effect.)*

##### Metamagic (lvl 3)
+ **Careful spell:** Also, chosen creatures take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. *(From 2024)*
+ **Extend Spell:** If the affected spell requires concentration, you have advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that concentration. *(From 2024)*
+ **Heightened Spell:** Costs only 2 sorcery points and the target suffers disadvantage on all of the saves it make against that spell. *(From 2024)*
+ **Subtle Spell:** Also includes ignoring non-costly material components that are not consumed. *(From 2024)*
+ **Twinned Spell:** Costs 1 + spell level to twin a spell.  If the spell can be cast with a higher level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can instead spend 1 sorcery point to increase the spell's effective level by 1. *(From 2024, but also keeping original version at +1 cost)*

##### Sorcerous Recovery (+lvl 3)
Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your sorcerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. *(Inspired by 2024's lvl 5 Sorcerous Restoration, but using the same existing mechanic as Wizard & Druid:Land.)*

##### Sorcery Incarnate (+lvl 7)
* You can spend two sorcery points as a bonus action to activate your Innate Sorcery aura.
* Whenever your Innate Sorcery aura is active, you can apply up to two of your metamagic options on each spell you cast.
* *(From 2024)*

##### Origin: Aberrant Mind

##### Origin: Divine Soul
**Spellcasting: Divine Magic (lvl 1):** 
* You do not gain a spell based on your affinity.
* Instead, choose the domain spell list from one cleric domain. As you gain access to each spell level, choose one of the domain spells of that level to learn. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

##### Origin: Draconic Bloodline
**Spellcasting: Draconic Spells (+lvl 1):** 
1. Command, Chromatic Orb
2. Alter Self, Dragon's Breath
3. Fear, Fly

1. False Life, Silent Image
2. Darkvision, Shadow Blade*
3. Fear, Life Transference*

**Spellcasting: Wild Spells (+lvl 1):**
You gain one bonus spell known at each spell level, up to the highest sorcerer spell level that you can currently cast (max: 5).  For example, at sorcerer level 5, you would know one bonus level 1 spell, one bonus level 2 spell, and one bonus level 3 spell.

When you gain access to a new bonus spell known through this means, randomly select a sorcerer spell of that spell level.  If this produces a spell you already know, roll again.

Each time you level up, you can choose to regenerate your full list of bonus spells known. Randomly select a new sorcerer spell for each bonus spell level that you have.


### Warlock

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Warlock Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*
+ Additional Pact Boon option (lvl 3)
+ Additional Eldritch Invocation options (lvl 2+)

##### Spellcasting (lvl 1)
**Patron: Expanded Spell List**. In addition to adding these spells to your spell list, you may choose one patron spell per spell level to add to your spells known. This does not count against your spells known limit.  *(Half of 2024's buff)*

##### Invocations (lvl 2)
**Improved Pact of the Blade:** You can also conjure any melee weapon. *(To correspond with the updated Pact of the Blade below)*

##### Pact Boon (lvl 3)
Replaced **Pact of the Blade:** 
+ As a bonus action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand. This is a simple or martial melee weapon that lacks the two-handed property. The weapon counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunity. The weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet from you for 1 minute or more, if you dismiss it as a free action, if you conjure another pact weapon, or if you die.
+ While wielding your pact weapon, you have proficiency with the weapon, can use it as a spellcasting focus, and can use your Charisma in place of Strength or Dexterity when you attack with it.
+ You can perform a 1-hour ritual, which can be performed over a short rest, to bond with a magical weapon you touch and make it your pact weapon. You can't bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or has bonded with it as a pact weapon, if it is a sentient or artifact weapon, or if it is of a weapon type you could not conjure as a pact weapon. You remain bonded until you die, bond with a different weapon, or perform a similar 1-hour ritual to break the bond. While bonded, whenever you conjure a pact weapon, the bonded weapon teleports to your hand if it is on the same plane of existence. You cannot conjure any other pact weapon while so bonded.
*(From 2024, mostly, while retaining some of the original flavor and limitations)*

##### Patron: Archfey
Add *misty step* to the patron expanded spell list. *(From 2024)*

**Fey Presence (lvl 1):** This effect lasts for 1 minute.

**Misty Escape (lvl 6):** When you use this feature, you can choose any number of creatures within 5' of the space you left. Those creatures must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 psychic damage. *(Inspired by 2024, which significantly changed this subclass)*

##### Patron: Fiend
**Dark One's Blessing (lvl 1):** You also gain these temporary hit points if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 hit points. *(From 2024)*

##### Patron: Hexblade
**Disallowed.**  *(The Hexblade lacks good flavor, and iit s regularly abused for small Warlock dips. Given the change to Pact of the Blade above to capture the essence of a martial warlock, there is less value to this subclass. If you have a good story reason for this patron, we can talk.)*


### Wizard

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Wizard Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*

##### Scholar (+lvl 2)
Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You gain Expertise in the chosen skill. *(From 2024)*

##### Memorize Spell (+lvl 5)
Whenever you finish a short rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one prepared spell with another chosen from the book. *(From 2024)*

##### Tradition: School Savant (lvl 2)
For each of the 8 subclasses that specialize in a school of magic, you gain a corresponding Savant feature. Add to this Savant feature: 
* When you gain this feature, and each time you gain access to a new level of wizard spell slots, you can add a new wizard spell of your chosen school to your spellbook for free. This spell must be of a level you can cast.
* You can prepare extra spells, provided that those spells are of your chosen school. You can prepare an extra level 1 spell at wizard level 2, an extra level 2 spell at level 3, an extra level 3 spell at level 5, an extra level 4 spell at level 7, and an extra level 5 spell at level 9.
*(From 2024, plus gain bonus spells prepared)*

##### Tradition: Abjuration
**Arcane Ward (lvl 2):** You can only create or recharge the ward **when you expend a spell slot** to cast an abjuration spell.  Apply any of your immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities to the damage you take before reducing the ward's hit points. *(From 2024)*

##### Tradition: Evocation
You may choose to swap the order in which you gain the Sculpt Spells and Potent Cantrip features. *(From 2024)*

##### Tradition: War Magic
 **Power Surge (lvl 6):** Replace with: 
 + You can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging battlefield spells. When you force multiple creatures to make saving throws against the damage of one of your spells, you can increase the spell’s damage by half your wizard level. This increase occurs only on the turn that you cast the spell. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest or until you successfully end a spell with *dispel magic* or *counterspell*.  *(Original UA version, merged with current version. Personal reason: "Glaucus")*


### Design Notes

##### Domain Spells

TCE's Aberrant Mind and Clockwork Soul subclasses for the Sorcerer added "domain spells" to the sorcerer: Two spells known per spell level.  2024 kept this design and doubled-down on it by also giving domain spells to the Draconic Bloodline. They then gave the Sorcerer 7 more spells known overall and gave the Warlock subclasses domain spells.

I'm not a big fan of this direction because I think of the Wizard as the versatile arcane spellcaster.  Both the Sorcerer and Warlock should have a handful of powerful spells, favoring evocation and damage, that they can cast more often than the Wizard. But the Wizard did not receive any increase in versatility other than the ability to swap out one spell per short rest at level 5. 

However, rather than completely bucking the direction of the game, I've come up with a compromise I'm comfortable with.  All three of these arcane spellcasters--Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard--get one additional domain spell known per spell levels 1 through 5. (There may be some subclass exceptions.) And the Sorcerer gets to recover spell slots at least as well as the Wizard.

Speaking of domain spells, I'm also not a fan of cleric domains that give you access to only cleric spells that you could choose to prepare yourself.  While it is nice to have such spells always prepared to support the theme of your domain in play, it'd be nice to sometimes have some some personal options regarding the details of that theme.
