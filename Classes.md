##### Rage
* You can rage for up to 10 minutes.

* You recover 1 rage with a short rest and all of them with a long rest.
* *(Additions/changes from 2024)*

##### Path: Berserker
**Frenzy (lvl 3):** When you enter a frenzied rage, you can choose to suffer the effects of Reckless Attack for the duration of that rage. If you do so, you do not suffer exhaustion at the end of the rage. *(Inspired by 2024, but keeping the original Frenzy benefit)*

**Intimidating Presence (lvl 10):** If you are raging, this can be performed as a bonus action, initially and on subsequent turns.  This can be the same bonus action that you use to enter or prolong your rage. *(Inspired by 2024 and its general Influence action.)*

##### Path: Totem Warrior
**Totem Spirit: Bear (lvl 3):**  Grants resistance only to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder, but **not to force, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage**.  *(From 2024, because this totem otherwise tends to dominate over all totems and even other paths.)*


### Bard

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Bard Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*

##### Bardic Inspiration
You can decide to apply a Bardic Inspiration die to a roll after learning whether the initial roll succeeds or fails. *(From 2024)*

+ Additional Cleric Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*
+ Blessed Strikes (lvl8)

##### Harness Divine Power (lvl 2)
As an **action**, you can expend a use of Channel Divinity to regain a **level 1 spell slot**. You can do this once per long rest at level 2, twice per long rest at level 6, and three times per long rest at level 18. *(From TCE, but slower to use and the spell level doesn't scale)*

##### Domain: Arcana
**Divine Domain (lvl 1):** When you first gain access to these domain spells, you may make any of these swaps: 

1. *detect magic* for *identify*

##### Domain: Knowledge

4. *guardian of faith* for either *aura of life* or *aura of purity*
5. *raise dead* for *greater restoration*

##### Domain: Nature

**Bonus Proficiency (lvl 1):** You may trade proficiency with heavy armor for a second skill proficiency choice from those provided by Acolyte of Nature.

**Eyes of Night (lvl 1):** You receive **darkvision only to the normal 60' range**.

**Twilight Sanctuary (lvl 2):** A creature **receives temporary hit points only once** per use of this ability, immediately at the time the sanctuary appears. *(Personal reason: "Fortuna")*

##### Domain: War
**War Priest (lvl 1):** You do not need to take the Attack action to use this feature. *(From 2024)*

**Channel Divinity: Guided Strike (lvl 2):** Alternatively, you can give this benefit to a creature within 30 feet of you if you also use your reaction.  *(From 2024; basically, you can also use 2014's  War God's Blessing here too.)*

**War God's Blessing (lvl 6):** Replace with:
+ You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast *shield of faith* or *spiritual weapon* without expending a spell slot.  When you cast the spell this way, it does not require Concentration. The spell lasts for its full duration, but it ends early if you cast the spell again, are incapacitated, or die. *(From 2024)*


### Druid
##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Druid Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*
+ Wild Companion (lvl 2) - But only for Circle of the Dreams, Land, and Stars. Summoned familiars are beasts with intelligence 5. May include the following additional creatures as options: almiraj/jackalope, awakened shrub (can't speak), badger, deer, eagle, fox, hare, jackal/coyote, vulture.  The creature's attack bonus can be replaced with DEX+2 (eg, cat).  This familiar can attack on its turn, but it deals a max of 2 base damage per hit (eg, almiraj, etc).

##### Circle: Land
**Circle Spells (lvl 2):** When you complete a long rest in a natural setting, you can choose to swap the land of your Circle Spells to that of the terrain you rested in.  *(Slight buff to Land)*

##### Circle: Wildfire
**Summon Wildfire Spirit (lvl 2):** The Wildfire Spirit **does not have the Fiery Teleportation** feature.  *(Personal reason: "Fortuna")*


### Fighter

+ Additional Maneuver options

##### Archetype: Champion

**Improved Second Wind (+lvl 3):** When you use your Second Wind, you regain additional hit points equal to your CON modifier (min: 0).

**Remarkable Athlete (lvl 7):** Replace with:
* You gain proficiency with Athletics. If you already have proficiency, gain expertise instead.  If you already have expertise, gain advantage instead.
* Immediately after you use your Second Wind or score a critical hit, you can move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
* *(Inspired by 2024)*


### Monk

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Dedicated Weapon (lvl 2)
+ Ki-Fueled Attack (lvl 3)
+ Quickened Healing (lvl 4)

##### Deflect Missiles (lvl 3)
Rename to **Deflect Attacks**. You can also deflect melee weapon attacks. If you reduce the damage to 0 and pay 1 ki to redirect a melee weapon attack, you must target another creature within 5' of you. For either a ranged or melee attack, resolve the redirected attack as if for a martial arts (unarmed or equivalent monk weapon) attack.  *(From 2024, mostly)*

##### Stunning Strike (lvl 5)
If the target succeeds its CON save, it still suffers an effect: Its speed is halved and it cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn. *(Inspired by 2024)*

##### Way: Shadow
**Shadow Arts (lvl 3):** You can give up *minor illusion* to add *shadow blade* to your list of 2-ki spells. You can only cast *darkvision* on yourself.  *(Have done this in two campaigns now.)*


### Paladin
##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Paladin Spells (lvl 2) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*
+ Additional Fighting Style options

##### Harness Divine Power (lvl 2)
As an **action**, you can expend a use of Channel Divinity to regain a **level 1 spell slot**. You can do this once per long rest. *(From TCE, but slower to use and the spell level doesn't scale)*

##### Divine Smite (lvl 2)
This **requires a bonus action**, which can be performed upon hitting a creature with a melee weapon attack.  (See also: [Spells](Spells.md): Smite)  Alternatively, you can spend a bonus action when you make a ranged attack. However, if the attack then misses, the smite is wasted.  *(Change to a bonus action comes from 2024; ranged option comes from a past house rule. Personal reason for switching to bonus action: "bag of beans' mummy lord")*

##### Oath: Devotion
**Channel Divinity (lvl 3): Sacred Weapon.** You can do this as a bonus action.  *(Personal reason: "Angel")*


### Ranger

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Ranger Spells (lvl 2) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*
	+ Except *Searing Smite* *(not added in 2024)*
+ Additional Fighting Style options
+ Spellcasting Focus (lvl 2)

These are also available replacements (although I personally prefer my improvements to the original 2014 version, given below): 

+ Deft Explorer (lvl 1)
+ Favored Foe (lvl 2)
+ Primal Awareness (lvl 3)

##### Favored Enemy (lvl 1)
* Add your proficiency bonus to weapon damage rolls dealt to your favored enemies.
* As part of a level up, you may replace one favored enemy type with another. You must have fought and learned more about this new favored enemy during your adventures. You cannot change any associated language that you have learned, but, if your initial favored enemy choice did not give you a language, you can choose one now.

##### Natural ExplorerÂ (lvl 1)
You gain these additional movement benefits while in one of your favored terrains:

+ You can ignore non-magical difficult terrain (as per the first half of lvl 8's Land Stride).
+ You can Hide as a bonus Action
+ You have advantage on initiative rolls

As part of a level up, you may replace one favored terrain with another that you have explored during your adventures.

##### Spellcasting (lvl 2)
You can prepare your spells, choosing to replace any of them each long rest, like a druid or paladin.  *(Added for consistency; also in 2024)*

##### Primeval Awareness (lvl 3)
Optionally, instead of spending a spell slot, you can spend 1 minute in uninterrupted concentration to sense the presence of any favored enemies (only). *(Option used in one campaign.)*

##### Land's Stride (lvl 8)
*Add:* You can Dash as a bonus Action.

##### Ambusher (+lvl 9)
+ You have advantage on initiative rolls (regardless of the current terrain)
+ You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet taken a turn in combat.

##### Hide in Plain Sight (lvl 10)
*Replace with:* You can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself befitting the local environment and infusing it with the powers of nature. You must have access to a disguise kit or to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once camouflaged, you can attempt to hide even if you are only lightly obscured by natural phenomena (such as foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, or mist) or if you are up against a solid surface that is at least as tall and wide as you are.  When you hide while camouflaged in this way, you automatically become invisible (no roll needed) for as long as you remain motionless. *(A blend of 2014's gritty-but-lame version and TCE/2024's auto-magical invisibility.)*

##### Natural Explorer Improvement (lvl 10)
You can select from any of these additional favored terrains that you have adventured in: dungeon, planar (specific plane), urban.

##### Favored Enemy Improvement (lvl 14)
You gain advantage on saving throws against the innate spells and abilities of any non-humanoid favored enemies. 

##### Archetype: Beast Master
*(The original Ranger's Companion feels weak and is hard to balance over all possible animals. TCE's Primal Companion mostly became the 2024 version. It is good if you want to summon an obviously magical spirit creature. The following Beast Companion option attempts to blend the two to retain the original's realism and various animal options while still incorporating TCE's buffs, simplicity, and scaling.)*

**Beast Companion (lvl 3):** You form a bond with a natural creature (beast), which is then subtly augmented by your magic.

+ To form a new bond, you can spend a short rest with a willing beast that is not hostile to you. Alternatively, you can spend a long rest to summon a native beast from the natural wilds around you.
+ The stat block of the beast depends on its type; see below.
+ The bonded beast is friendly to you and your companions. It understands the languages you know, and it obeys your verbal commands as best as it can. 
+ In combat, the beast shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast will focus on protecting you or itself, and it can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
+ While traveling through your favored terrain with only your beast companion, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
+ If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with 1 hit point. Like any creature, the beast can spend Hit Dice during a short rest and recovers all hit points on a long rest.
+ Your bond ends if you die. You can also end your bond over a short or long rest. When a bond ends, a living beast returns to the local wilds. If you later summon a native creature again in the same area, you can choose to recall a previously bonded companion.

<!-- Considering:  Healing spells that you cast on your beast companion restore double hit points. -->

Your beast companion uses TCE's Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky stat block, but modified as follows based on the specific type of the beast.

**_Beast of the Sea_** 

+ Sea beasts breathe either air or water.  The table below states how long they can survive (hold their breath) in the other element.
+ Attack benefit: Grapple is the default. This grapple effect is limited to creatures up to one size larger. It may be replaced by the noted ability.

**_Beast of the Sky_**

+ Examples include: **Eagle**, **Hawk**, **Owl**, **Raven**.  All as is.

**Exceptional Training (lvl 7):** When you use your bonus action to command your beast to take an action, you can also command it to use its bonus action to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help. *(From 2024)*

<!--
Sorely tempted... but Giant Killer got cut in 2024, so let's not bother to redeem it here.

##### Archetype: Hunter
**Hunter's Prey (lvl 3):** Add **Retaliator:** When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.  *(Intended to replace the never-used Giant Killer option. Just dropping the Large+ restriction felt too strong, so this also requires that you actually get hit first.)*
-->

### Rogue

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Steady Aim (lvl 3)

##### Cunning Strike (+lvl 5)
When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can forgo rolling one of the d6 dice to instead add one of these effects to your attack. The DC for these effects equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + DEX. 
* **Poison:** The target makes a Constitution save or is poisoned for 1 minute.  It can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. You must have a poisoner's kit on your person to produce this effect. 
* **Sap:** The target has disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.
* **Slow:** The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. This effect does not stack.
* **Trip:** If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it makes a Dexterity save or falls prone. (Melee attacks only.) 
* **Vex:** You have advantage on your next attack roll against the target until the end of your next turn.
* **Withdraw:** Immediately after you deal damage, move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. (Melee attacks only.)
* *(From 2024; some limited to only melee attacks and three 2024 weapon property effects added.)*

##### Reliable Talent (+lvl 7)
You can gain lvl 11's Reliable Talent benefit at lvl 7. *(From 2024)*

##### Improved Cunning Strike (+lvl 11)
You can use two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage. You must pay the die cost for each effect. *(From 2024)*


### Sorcerer

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Sorcerer Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*
+ Additional Metamagic Options (lvl 3)
	+ Seeking Spell only costs +1 sorcery point *(From 2024)*

##### Spellcasting (lvl 1)
Most Sorcerous Origins give you list of origin spells: Two spells for each spell level between 1 and 5. If any of these origin spells are not sorcerer spells, you can add them to your class spell list, meaning that you can learn and cast them as sorcerer spells.  When you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of the given spell level, choose one of the origin spells provided for that spell level. You add that chosen spell as a bonus to your spells known.  You cannot replace that spell when you level up, except if you swap it for another spell of the same level from your origin spell list.

##### Innate Sorcery (+lvl 1)
As a bonus action, you can unleash an aura of raw magic for 1 minute. This always creates a visual effect around you related to your sorcerous origin, such as a spectral fire, swirling mists, flickering shadows, glowing eyes, crackling cold, etc. During this minute:
+ The spell save DC of your sorcerer spells increases by 1
+ You have advantage on the attack rolls of sorcerer spells you cast
You can use this feature once per long rest. *(From 2024, half as often, plus a visual effect.)*

##### Sorcerous Recovery (+lvl 2)
Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your sorcerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. *(Inspired by 2024's lvl 5 Sorcerous Restoration, but using the same existing mechanic as Wizard & Druid:Land. At level 2 to require more than a single level dip.)*

<!--
Sorcery Points: You cannot use sorcery points to create new spell slots. Instead, you can recover expended spell slots equivalent to those you would have created.
-->

##### Metamagic (lvl 3)
+ **Careful spell:** Also, chosen creatures take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. *(From 2024)*
+ **Extend Spell:** If the affected spell requires concentration, you have advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that concentration. *(From 2024)*
+ **Heightened Spell:** Costs only 2 sorcery points and the target suffers disadvantage on all of the saves it make against that spell. *(From 2024)*
+ **Subtle Spell:** Also includes ignoring non-costly material components that are not consumed. *(From 2024)*

##### Origin: Wild Magic
You (rather than the DM) can choose whether to roll the Wild Magic Surge d20 or to roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to recover your use of Tides of Chaos. You cannot use metamagic on spells you cast from the Wild Mage table. *(From 2024)*

The DM may choose to vary or adlib Wild Magic Surge effects.

**Spellcasting: Wild Spells (+lvl 1):**
You gain one bonus spell known at each spell level, up to the highest sorcerer spell level that you can currently cast (max: 5).  For example, at sorcerer level 5, you would know one bonus level 1 spell, one bonus level 2 spell, and one bonus level 3 spell.

When you gain access to a new bonus spell known through this means, randomly select a PHB sorcerer spell of that spell level.  If this produces a spell you already know, roll again.

Each time you level up, you can choose to regenerate your full list of bonus spells known. Randomly select a new PHB sorcerer spell for each bonus spell level that you have. (See Spellcasting, above, for more.)


### Warlock

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Warlock Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*
+ Additional Pact Boon option (lvl 3)
+ Additional Eldritch Invocation options (lvl 2+)

##### Spellcasting (lvl 1)
**Patron: Expanded Spell List**. In addition to adding these spells to your spell list, you may choose one patron spell per spell level to add to your spells known. This does not count against your spells known limit.  *(Half of 2024's buff)*

##### Invocations (lvl 2)
**Improved Pact Weapon:** You can also conjure any melee weapon. *(To correspond with the updated Pact of the Blade below)*

##### Pact Boon (lvl 3)
Replaces **Pact of the Blade:** 
+ As a bonus action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand. You can choose the form of this weapon each time. It must be a simple or martial melee weapon that lacks the two-handed property. The weapon counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunity. The weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet from you for 1 minute or more, if you dismiss it as a free action, if you conjure another pact weapon, or if you die.
+ While wielding your pact weapon, you have proficiency with the weapon, can use it as a spellcasting focus, and can use your Charisma in place of Strength or Dexterity when you attack with it.
+ You can perform a 1-hour ritual, which can be performed over a short rest, to bond with a magical weapon you touch and make it your pact weapon. You can't bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or has bonded with it as a pact weapon, if it is a sentient or artifact weapon, or if it is of a weapon type you could not conjure as a pact weapon. You remain bonded until you die, bond with a different weapon, or perform a similar 1-hour ritual to break the bond. While bonded, whenever you conjure a pact weapon, the bonded weapon teleports to your hand if it is on the same plane of existence. You cannot conjure any other pact weapon while so bonded.
*(From 2024, mostly, while retaining some of the original 2014 flavor and limitations)*

##### Patron: Archfey
Add *misty step* to the patron expanded spell list. *(From 2024)*

**Fey Presence (lvl 1):** This effect lasts for 1 minute.

**Misty Escape (lvl 6):** When you use this feature, you can choose any number of creatures within 5' of the space you left. Those creatures must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 psychic damage. *(Inspired by 2024, which significantly changed this subclass)*

##### Patron: Fiend
**Dark One's Blessing (lvl 1):** You also gain these temporary hit points if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 hit points. *(From 2024)*

##### Patron: Hexblade
**Disallowed.**  *(The Hexblade lacks good flavor, and it is regularly abused for short Warlock dips. Given the change to Pact of the Blade above to capture the essence of a martial warlock, there is less value to this subclass. If you still have a good story reason for this patron, we can talk.)*


### Wizard

##### Allowed TCE Options

+ Additional Wizard Spells (lvl 1) - Added to class spell list. *(As per 2024 too)*

##### Scholar (+lvl 2)
Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You gain Expertise in the chosen skill. *(From 2024)*

##### Memorize Spell (+lvl 5)
Whenever you finish a short rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one prepared spell with another chosen from the book. *(From 2024)*

##### Tradition: School Savant (lvl 2)
For each of the 8 subclasses that specialize in a school of magic, you gain a corresponding Savant feature. Add to this Savant feature: 
* When you gain this feature, and each time you gain access to a new level of wizard spell slots, you can add a new wizard spell of your chosen school to your spellbook for free. This spell must be of a level you can cast.
* You can prepare extra spells, provided that those spells are of your chosen school. You can prepare an extra level 1 spell at wizard level 2, an extra level 2 spell at level 3, an extra level 3 spell at level 5, an extra level 4 spell at level 7, and an extra level 5 spell at level 9.
*(From 2024, plus gain bonus spells prepared)*

##### Tradition: Abjuration
**Arcane Ward (lvl 2):** You can only create or recharge the ward **when you expend a spell slot** to cast an abjuration spell.  Apply any of your immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities to the damage you take before reducing the ward's hit points. *(From 2024)*

##### Tradition: Evocation
You may choose to swap the order in which you gain the Sculpt Spells and Potent Cantrip features. *(From 2024)*

##### Tradition: War Magic
 **Power Surge (lvl 6):** Replace with: 
 + You can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging battlefield spells. When you force multiple creatures to make saving throws against the damage of one of your spells, you can increase the spellâs damage by half your wizard level. This increase occurs only on the turn that you cast the spell. Once you use this feature, you canât use it again until you finish a short or long rest or until you successfully end a spell with *dispel magic* or *counterspell*.  *(Original UA version, merged with current version. Personal reason: "Glaucus")*


### Design Notes

##### Domain Spells

TCE's Aberrant Mind and Clockwork Soul subclasses for the Sorcerer added "domain spells" to the sorcerer: Two spells known per spell level.  2024 kept this design and doubled-down on it by also giving domain spells to the Draconic Bloodline. They then gave the Sorcerer 7 more spells known overall and gave the Warlock subclasses domain spells.

I'm not a big fan of this direction because I think of the Wizard as the versatile arcane spellcaster.  I think both the Sorcerer and Warlock should have a handful of powerful spells, favoring evocation and damage, that they can cast more often than the Wizard. But the Wizard did not receive any increase in versatility other than the ability to swap out one spell per short rest at level 5. 

However, rather than completely bucking the direction of the game, I've come up with a compromise I'm comfortable with.  All three of these arcane spellcasters--Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard--get one additional domain spell known at spell levels 1 through 5. (There may be some subclass exceptions.) And the Sorcerer gets to recover spell slots at least as well as the Wizard.

Speaking of domain spells, I'm also not a fan of cleric domains that give you access to only cleric spells that you could choose to prepare yourself.  While it is nice to have such spells always prepared to support the theme of your domain in play, it'd be nice to sometimes have some some personal options regarding the details of that theme. Thus, I've added the option to customize certain cleric domains to a small degree.
