##### Rituals
The Ritual Caster class feature is not required to cast a ritual spell.  Any spellcaster who has a ritual spell known or prepared can cast that spell as a ritual.  *(From 2024)*

Narratively, a ritual spell generally takes +1 minute (instead of +10 minutes) to cast.

##### Components
If you are holding a spell focus in one hand, you can use that hand to perform somatic components, even if the spell you are casting has no material components.  You can also use this hand to touch a target, as this is equivalent to extending a forefinger, dropping and recovering (juggling) the focus, or just using the focus itself as a conduit. *(This helps avoid some weirdness about a SM spell being easier to cast than a S spell.)*
