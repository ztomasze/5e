spellcasting
If you are holding a spell focus in one hand, you can use that hand to perform somatic components, even if the spell you are casting has no material components.  You can also use this hand to touch a target, as this is equivalent to extending a forefinger, dropping and recovering (juggling) the focus, or just using the focus itself as a conduit.
